&lt;p&gt;I don't agree with glyph that you shouldn't leave your comfort zone. In
fact, you should leave your comfort zone and &lt;a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/programmers-resolutions/"&gt;embrace the
uncomfortable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Posted by: Anand (noreply@blogger.com)</title><link href="http://code.mumak.net/2012/06/tricks-for-exploring-new-languages.html/#comment-3702855860213210332.md" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-06-28T04:11:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Anand (noreply@blogger.com)</name></author><id>tag:code.mumak.net,2012-06-28:2012/06/tricks-for-exploring-new-languages.html/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been struggling with the same trouble. Trying to learn Haskell from
long time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've learnt Scheme in the past at a quite good pace by studying
&lt;a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/"&gt;SICP&lt;/a&gt;. I think having incremental
exercises to try makes it easier to learn a new language. I haven't
found something like that for Haskell yet.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Posted by: glyph (noreply@blogger.com)</title><link href="http://code.mumak.net/2012/06/tricks-for-exploring-new-languages.html/#comment-4322607920255838116.md" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-06-26T06:17:00+01:00</updated><author><name>glyph (noreply@blogger.com)</name></author><id>tag:code.mumak.net,2012-06-26:2012/06/tricks-for-exploring-new-languages.html/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Perhaps don't push yourself so hard to leave the Python ecosystem
entirely; if you're comfortable there, and that's what you really want
to be doing with your spare time, don't fight it, embrace it. For
example, I have a reasonably good grasp of ObjC and a pretty wide
breadth of ObjC APIs now due to messing with PyObjC bridging. If you
want to learn Go, and no Python-Go bridge exists, make one, and I'm sure
you'll learn a ton about the Go runtime :). Then you can do some things
up to the edge of your comfort zone, and when you get to something that
Python isn't good at, you can switch over into the new thing and have a
more concrete motivation to learn it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Or, you know, just stay in Python but dive into the deep end. I'm sure
you can gain complete understanding of all current and possible
programming languages by working on sufficiently deep internals in
PyPy...)&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Posted by: chrome___ (noreply@blogger.com)</title><link href="http://code.mumak.net/2012/06/tricks-for-exploring-new-languages.html/#comment-481045057637072355.md" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-06-25T10:14:00+01:00</updated><author><name>chrome___ (noreply@blogger.com)</name></author><id>tag:code.mumak.net,2012-06-25:2012/06/tricks-for-exploring-new-languages.html/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Good question -- I have the same problem.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things that helped me in the past (eg. learning Erlang) was the
(probably) usual anti-procrastination stuff: *) set aside some fixed
time *) set goals eg. "I'll complete this-and-this prototype by
tomorrow", *) tons of external pressure *) keep a journal to reflect
on the cool stuff you've learned  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd be very interested what other people do...&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Posted by: jml (noreply@blogger.com)</title><link href="http://code.mumak.net/2012/06/tricks-for-exploring-new-languages.html/#comment-6666365735424906819.md" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-06-26T08:09:00+01:00</updated><author><name>jml (noreply@blogger.com)</name></author><id>tag:code.mumak.net,2012-06-26:2012/06/tricks-for-exploring-new-languages.html/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Keeping a journal, or at least a place to dump notes is something I do a
lot of. Collaborators &amp;amp; long-time readers of this blog have my
bullet-pointed reflections inflicted on them more than once.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On G+, Gustavo recommended picking a project for which the result
matters, but not necessarily the timeliness. I think that's a really
good idea.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Posted by: Unknown (noreply@blogger.com)</title><link href="http://code.mumak.net/2012/06/tricks-for-exploring-new-languages.html/#comment-7269071976072221371.md" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-06-25T12:19:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Unknown (noreply@blogger.com)</name></author><id>tag:code.mumak.net,2012-06-25:2012/06/tricks-for-exploring-new-languages.html/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Deep-end.
