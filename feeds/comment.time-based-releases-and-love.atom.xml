It's quite nice to have the new
features on a packaged format earlier. The developer are forced to keep
the project in a "releasable" state more often too.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I'd ask, *please*, don't add new default repository formats so
often.&lt;br /&gt;
My proposal: do time-based *major* (2.0, 3.0, ...) releases too, every
6 months for example, and add a new default format only to this
releases.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new format, accumulating all backward incompatible changes, could be
developed on a branch and integrated as a --development format when its
good enough (like it is now), but only released as the default on a
major release.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way, distributions can offer always a bzr with the latest (or
almost) format, and teams/hosting sites/sysadmins can get prepared to
upgrade their repos less often.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Posted by: Mary (noreply@blogger.com)</title><link href="http://code.mumak.net/2009/03/time-based-releases-and-love.html/#comment-3467960932830685026.md" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-04-02T05:12:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Mary (noreply@blogger.com)</name></author><id>tag:code.mumak.net,2009-04-02:2009/03/time-based-releases-and-love.html/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My thoughts are not as specific as other commenters, but essentially:
bzr does not provide any way to judge the level of change in its
releases: the number is essentially 1.X where X is the number of months
since 1.0 (give or take).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Ubuntu also uses a similar strategy, most Free Software people
really are accustomed to X.Y where a change in X means big changes
including likely major fixes and improvements but also to beware of
breakage, and a change in Y means tweaks to what you know, breakage
unlikely. (For projects with dependant projects, X.Y.Z is better where a
change in Z means no ABI/API break from the previous release, as
required.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, one can get this from the release notes, but one doesn't read
them...&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Posted by: Eduardo de Oliveira Padoan (noreply@blogger.com)</title><link href="http://code.mumak.net/2009/03/time-based-releases-and-love.html/#comment-3468572292567331193.md" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-04-02T12:08:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Eduardo de Oliveira Padoan (noreply@blogger.com)</name></author><id>tag:code.mumak.net,2009-04-02:2009/03/time-based-releases-and-love.html/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;@bialix: I think that point releases (especially when security fixes and
fixes for major regression are involved) should be released any time if
needed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If bzr is to move to a longer release cycle (3 months, say), it can
still do montly alpha/beta releases: an alpha on the end of the first
month, a beta on the end of the second one (if no release critical bug
id found, them is could slip some days), and a rc or two on the week
before the final release.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Posted by: Eduardo de Oliveira Padoan (noreply@blogger.com)</title><link href="http://code.mumak.net/2009/03/time-based-releases-and-love.html/#comment-3590099636265162880.md" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-04-01T12:58:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Eduardo de Oliveira Padoan (noreply@blogger.com)</name></author><id>tag:code.mumak.net,2009-04-01:2009/03/time-based-releases-and-love.html/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Also, If new formats had a big set of new features (instead of the
one-format-per-new-feature-every-now-and-again like it is now), people
would be more excited about upgrading. At least brisbane-core is
something everybody will be really *really* excited about :)&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Posted by: Cory (noreply@blogger.com)</title><link href="http://code.mumak.net/2009/03/time-based-releases-and-love.html/#comment-5656991530384186263.md" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-04-01T06:04:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Cory (noreply@blogger.com)</name></author><id>tag:code.mumak.net,2009-04-01:2009/03/time-based-releases-and-love.html/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have to agree with Eduardo there. One of the reasons specifically
cited by Brett Cannon today when discussing Python-on-hg is the number
of changes to release formats in bzr.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that has way more of an impact on the impression of stability
than does the frequency of releases; people just want to know it will
always work wherever they happen to need some code, regardless of what
version is installed there.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't see any reason to question the basic concept of always being
ready to release, but that's not the same as releasing all the time. :-)
Every month is good for a pre-1.0, after that, 3 or 6 months is a better
pace to set. Being ready gives you the ability to do a critical bugfix
release at the drop of a hat.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Posted by: bialix (noreply@blogger.com)</title><link href="http://code.mumak.net/2009/03/time-based-releases-and-love.html/#comment-7154288789609202402.md" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-04-01T18:47:00+01:00</updated><author><name>bialix (noreply@blogger.com)</name></author><id>tag:code.mumak.net,2009-04-01:2009/03/time-based-releases-and-love.html/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think bzr practive to release every 4 weeks is too frequent for the
most users/admins. Once at 2 or 3 months is much better.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May be only point releases, e.g. 1.13.X should be released once at
month.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.g. for version X.Y.Z  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Z = every month (only bugfixes)&lt;br /&gt;
Y = every 3 months (improvements)&lt;br /&gt;
X = every 9-12 months (big improvements, new formats)&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
