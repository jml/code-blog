hear some fresh new thoughts (and to have a few old problems reiterated
so we remember to address them.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the feedback loop, I think the 'debug-hooks' command is going to
save you a lot of problems at least in terms of being able to run your
hook over and over until its "right". The problem is that unlike a test
suite, we are changing the system state *on purpose* so iterating
means getting back to the same starting state. I do think we need to
make better use of LXC's ability to clone containers in the debug-hooks
command, but network complexity becomes an issue, so we'll have to keep
working on this.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also for colorized logs:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;juju debug-log | ccze -A  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ccze tool's general rules will produce a pretty nicely highlighted
log for you. The ERROR issue remains, but I think we'll solve that soon
enough with the patch you submitted. :)&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Posted by: jml (noreply@blogger.com)</title><link href="http://code.mumak.net/2012/06/further-reflections-on-my-first-juju.html/#comment-3706270712593603104.md" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-06-25T09:27:00+01:00</updated><author><name>jml (noreply@blogger.com)</name></author><id>tag:code.mumak.net,2012-06-25:2012/06/further-reflections-on-my-first-juju.html/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;@clint-fewbar, thanks for the 'ccze' tip. That's very useful, and not
just for juju charming.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;@Kapil, thanks. I discovered replay and log level filtering pretty early
on. The log level filtering was a bit annoying as -l ERROR didn't give
me &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the errors, included some non-errors, and didn't provide enough
context for the errors that were included.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not really sure what an agent is or how it matters.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Posted by: Kapil Thangavelu (noreply@blogger.com)</title><link href="http://code.mumak.net/2012/06/further-reflections-on-my-first-juju.html/#comment-4226975663023814159.md" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-06-23T00:40:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Kapil Thangavelu (noreply@blogger.com)</name></author><id>tag:code.mumak.net,2012-06-23:2012/06/further-reflections-on-my-first-juju.html/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;thanks for the feedback.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just fwiw, juju debug-log has very fine grained options for exactly
targeting what your interested in, you can listen in on a particular
agent or group of agents, exclude hook output, capture logs at a
particular level, replay logs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
