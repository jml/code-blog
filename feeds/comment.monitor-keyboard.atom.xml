At the moment this IPS
panel seems to be getting good reviews and is a reasonable price (NEC
EA231WMI-BK). Here's a good review of it:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://www.prad.de/en/monitore/review/2009/review-nec-ea231wmi-bk-part14.html  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's 1920x1200, but I haven't checked it will actually work with the
x200 yet. Also 23" might be a bit big for the office ;-)&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Posted by: muffinresearch (noreply@blogger.com)</title><link href="http://code.mumak.net/2010/03/monitor-keyboard.html/#comment-5943215760453475205.md" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-03-08T13:11:00+00:00</updated><author><name>muffinresearch (noreply@blogger.com)</name></author><id>tag:code.mumak.net,2010-03-08:2010/03/monitor-keyboard.html/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I personally really like Unicomp keyboards which are basically Modern
manufactured IBM Model M Keyboards. They're clicky (which may not be for
everyone) but this provides excellent feedback and means you don't have
to hit the keys so hard as you do with rubber dome keyboards. See
http://pckeyboards.stores.yahoo.net/keyboards.html  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the monitor front I'm just looking into what's available myself. Top
of my list is the Eizo 2243 which is a 1920x1200 screen (PVA panel with
overdrive) in a 22" format alternatives to that would be Dell u2410 or
HP2475. Both of those are IPS panels with the same 1920x1200 but 24"
diagonal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above are higher quality panels for greater colour accuracy
and better viewing angles and should be similar quality or better to
Apple's Cinema displays.  &lt;/p&gt;

coding it's fine. For watching films you might want to spend a bit more
I guess.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My keyboard is from "that keyboard and mouse company" -- a Microsoft
Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000, and I quite like it. I definitely
prefer split keyboard but I know some people hate them...&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Posted by: huwshimi (noreply@blogger.com)</title><link href="http://code.mumak.net/2010/03/monitor-keyboard.html/#comment-8786663629648600612.md" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-03-09T07:43:00+00:00</updated><author><name>huwshimi (noreply@blogger.com)</name></author><id>tag:code.mumak.net,2010-03-09:2010/03/monitor-keyboard.html/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have a proper diNovo Edge and I love it to bits. Great tactile
response, really slim (I like flat keyboards, but that might be a
personal taste). It doesn't have a keypad which for me is a massive
plus, but I realise for others may be a problem. Also, not cheap.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also recently bought a Dell ST2410 24". It's probably the nicest
monitor I've used. Really good colours. All the proper HDMI connections
etc. Probably a good choice if price is at all an issue.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hrm, might sound a bit over positive, but they're probably the best two
bits of hardware I've ever bought.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Posted by: Wouter van Heyst (noreply@blogger.com)</title><link href="http://code.mumak.net/2010/03/monitor-keyboard.html/#comment-8877285042588715168.md" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-03-08T18:52:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Wouter van Heyst (noreply@blogger.com)</name></author><id>tag:code.mumak.net,2010-03-08:2010/03/monitor-keyboard.html/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Being so very used to laptop keyboards, I'm happy with the Logitech
