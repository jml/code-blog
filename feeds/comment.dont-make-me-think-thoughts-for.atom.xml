&lt;p&gt;I'm sorry you had a bad experience trying out Launchpad.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure what I can say about different projects having different
interfaces. We've made it a bit better recently, but there's still a way
to go, particularly wrt downloading files.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On making a project, there's a "Register a project" link on the front
page of Launchpad. If you ever want to try again, that's the place to go
to.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Posted by: The Casual Vegan (noreply@blogger.com)</title><link href="http://code.mumak.net/2010/11/dont-make-me-think-thoughts-for.html/#comment-4088554104965985463.md" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-11-19T18:23:00+00:00</updated><author><name>The Casual Vegan (noreply@blogger.com)</name></author><id>tag:code.mumak.net,2010-11-19:2010/11/dont-make-me-think-thoughts-for.html/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple comments about my launch pad experience.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interface changes too much from project to project.So I can never
find the download link, many projects don't even have one. Which means I
leave the site without the software.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to create my own project in Launch Pad. I've done it in
Source Forge. In Launch Pad, I literally couldn't figure out how to
start a project and add my code to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

We can rename "+junk" when we have
a simple, guided process for turning junk branches into trunks of new
projects.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, having dashboard as the homepage for logged in users is the plan.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Posted by: jml (noreply@blogger.com)</title><link href="http://code.mumak.net/2010/11/dont-make-me-think-thoughts-for.html/#comment-4972158324519576476.md" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-11-29T22:19:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jml (noreply@blogger.com)</name></author><id>tag:code.mumak.net,2010-11-29:2010/11/dont-make-me-think-thoughts-for.html/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thomi, I wouldn't say "awful", but there's definitely a lot of work to
be done. And you're right, it is hard: both because it is tricky,
uncertain work that requires careful judgement and because it's simply a
lot of work.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, without wanting to make too many promises, it's something that
I'd like to tackle in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Posted by: manny (noreply@blogger.com)</title><link href="http://code.mumak.net/2010/11/dont-make-me-think-thoughts-for.html/#comment-5494302315866497435.md" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-12-12T15:29:00+00:00</updated><author><name>manny (noreply@blogger.com)</name></author><id>tag:code.mumak.net,2010-12-12:2010/11/dont-make-me-think-thoughts-for.html/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;i agree with Vegan,  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Register a project" URL should be more obvious.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://launchpad.net/projects/+new  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that link should be at the bottom of every page with the other links.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Posted by: Thomi Richards (noreply@blogger.com)</title><link href="http://code.mumak.net/2010/11/dont-make-me-think-thoughts-for.html/#comment-8429088325105788732.md" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-11-29T20:45:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Thomi Richards (noreply@blogger.com)</name></author><id>tag:code.mumak.net,2010-11-29:2010/11/dont-make-me-think-thoughts-for.html/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my humble opinion the single biggest problem with the launchpad site
is that the UI is awful.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You frequently show way too much data on a single page, making simple
tasks harder (can't find the information amongst all the clutter), and
hard tasks just as hard. Think about the typical use cases for most
users, and optimise for them. Hide the advanced data somehow, and make
improvements for things users do all the time, rather than things a few
people do rarely.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I don't want to get down on you, since I really do love launchpad -
it's a great service (the best avilable, i think), but I suspect that
you need to take a step back from the UI and consider how a new user
might view it. It's a difficult task, especially for power users (which,
almost by definition you must be) of the product.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and when I say "you", I mean... you know... launchpad developers...
or whoever is responsible.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Posted by: jelmer (noreply@blogger.com)</title><link href="http://code.mumak.net/2010/11/dont-make-me-think-thoughts-for.html/#comment-8635247862376006474.md" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-11-19T16:57:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jelmer (noreply@blogger.com)</name></author><id>tag:code.mumak.net,2010-11-19:2010/11/dont-make-me-think-thoughts-for.html/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think those are all good points.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think being able to Undo a project (Deleting it) is very important.
Talking to various GitHub users this seems to be something that they
like a lot, where Launchpad's project creation feels heavyweight. Not
because it's got a larger form (it's got a few more, but not that much),
but because if you create a project it'll be there forever and you need
intervention from another human to get it deactivated. I realize we have
+junk (worst name EVAR), but that's not quite as useful as a lightweight
project.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It'd be great to have the hypothetical dashboard as the homepage for
logged in users.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
