Wow!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 minutes is too much. To run some tests between code edits, 50s is
really pushing it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My preferred method of development is to run the one test or TestCase
that exercises the code I'm working on, and trial has no problems doing
that. When I think I'm fine with that, then run the entire test suite.
Does Launchpad lack a good way to do that?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I can't make-a-change-run-a-test in about a 10 second cycle, there's
something wrong with my development environment and I won't rest until
it's fixed ...&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
