against this, but not enough to block it.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we also had the +0 (I think it is interesting, but not sure
it should be accepted.), etc.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though we switched to words pretty quickly. I still really miss the
"BB:tweak" vote.

veto. -1 is just a vote against. Whether or not you use it as veto is
subject to the terms of your voting agreement. :-) I've only known
Apache to use it as a veto.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Posted by: jml (noreply@blogger.com)</title><link href="http://code.mumak.net/2011/01/expressing-agreement-and-disagreement.html/#comment-5854478790741904542.md" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-01-25T18:49:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jml (noreply@blogger.com)</name></author><id>tag:code.mumak.net,2011-01-25:2011/01/expressing-agreement-and-disagreement.html/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thing is, there are plenty of things that I disagree with but would not

but I have never considered -1 as a veto, except where unanimous consent
is sought (but I can't remember being part of a vote like that). By that
I mean that it has never even occurred to me! My assumption has always
been that &lt;em&gt;agreement = sum(votes) &gt; 0&lt;/em&gt;, with +0 and -0 being a
non-influencing way to express inclination.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Posted by: jc (noreply@blogger.com)</title><link href="http://code.mumak.net/2011/01/expressing-agreement-and-disagreement.html/#comment-7477467095123229265.md" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-01-25T19:13:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jc (noreply@blogger.com)</name></author><id>tag:code.mumak.net,2011-01-25:2011/01/expressing-agreement-and-disagreement.html/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A quick read through of the apache rules says -1 is a veto only if
consensus is required. While we like consensus, we don't seem to require
it on LP, if there's broad agreement and a few holdouts. So in that
context, the -1 makes sense as disagreement.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But largely, I agree with deryck; I've seldom seen -1 used as veto in
practice.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Posted by: jkakar (noreply@blogger.com)</title><link href="http://code.mumak.net/2011/01/expressing-agreement-and-disagreement.html/#comment-7727165950314902721.md" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-01-26T19:34:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jkakar (noreply@blogger.com)</name></author><id>tag:code.mumak.net,2011-01-26:2011/01/expressing-agreement-and-disagreement.html/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My favourite vote is +1000, ie, "OMG AWESOME YES YES YES". :)&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
