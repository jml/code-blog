with a shared repo. Mostly, the branch comes first to see if the work in
a branch is even worth it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was working on a similar idea of doing the shared repo and branch in
one command thing. My idea was more about branching the trunk of another
project into a shared repo. However, while I could get basic
functionality, I got blocked on cases where the branch format is
incompatible with the repo created, and found it difficult to check the
existing branch's format, to make a compatible repo. I've tried a few
approaches to no avail. :(&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
