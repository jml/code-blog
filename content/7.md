Slug: 7

My headphones broke and I'm chasing down an erratic test failure with no
real leads.  
  
And yet Prince stands:  
  

> All 7 and well watch them fall  
> They stand in the way of love  
> And we will smoke them all  
> With an intellect and a savoir-faire  
> No one in the whole universe  
> Will ever compare  
> I am yours now and u are mine  
> And together well love through  
> All space and time, so dont cry  
> One day all 7 will die
