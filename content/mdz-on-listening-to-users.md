[Matt Zimmerman](http://mdzlog.alcor.net/) writes about whether we
shouldÂ [listen to
users](http://mdzlog.alcor.net/2011/03/07/listening-to-users/). It's a
great post, and you should read it, but the summary is:  
  

1.  If you want inspiration for a new product, don't listen to users,
    watch them
2.  To test whether a product is a good fit, ask users for feedback and
    listen to it
3.  If you want to incrementally improve an existing offering, don't
    listen, gather data

  
I'm over-simplifying, you should read the original post. I also wonder
whether it should be "when is it safe to not act on user feedback",
rather than "not listening" per se.
