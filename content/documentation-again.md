Documenting your code is *not* important. Well-documented code is not a
thing to be desired nor a goal to be sought. A lack of documentation is
not a problem to be solved. Everyone who tells you otherwise is lying.  
  
What *is* important is that other programmers can easily understand your
code and the intent behind it, and that *you* can understand the code
and the intent six months later.  
  
Documenting your code is merely a way of achieving that. It might even
be necessary for it. But do not confuse interface with implementation
and do not confuse what you want with how to get it.  
  
Solve the problem of confusing, opaque code. Aim for code that can be
easily understood. Document if necessary.
