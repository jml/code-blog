Recently, I've been accused of cheating at Inbox Zero, since although
I've got no email in my Inbox, I have twenty to thirty threads marked
down as things that need reading or following-up on.  
  
To these accusations, I have only one thing to say: you're doing it
wrong.  
  
Inbox Zero is a method, not a creed. It's not even very much of a goal.
It's a system that says:  
  

-   put all of your unprocessed *stuff* (in this case, email) in one
    place (your inbox),Â 
-   go through that pile of stuff one at a time
-   make a decision about what you need to do about it (e.g., "nothing",
    "reply", "actually read it")
-   record the results of that decision (put it in a folder; tag it)
-   remove the thing from the pile

  
Or rather, it's a succinct way of talking about how to apply GTD
principles to email.  
  
  

<div
style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">

The "Zero" refers to the size of that pile of unprocessed stuff, not the
number of things on your todo list.

</div>

  
  
If you don't have three hours spare to read GTD, you really ought to
spend one hour watching [Merlin Mann's video on Inbox
Zero](http://inboxzero.com/video/).
