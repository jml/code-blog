Ever been confused by people saying "this is Lean" or "that is Lean" or
"we should actually be using a cyclometric value-stream set-based
burndown kanban for this"? I have, so I thought I'd write a quick
pared-down cheat sheet to explain exactly what Lean is. A lean version
of Lean, if you will.

At the very least, Lean is seven principles which, we're told, we should
apply to making software.

1.  Eliminate waste
2.  Amplify learning
3.  Decide as late as possible
4.  Deliver as fast as possible
5.  Empower the team
6.  Build integrity in
7.  See the whole

The first principle is fundamental.
