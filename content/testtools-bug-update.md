Hello [testtools](https://launchpad.net/testtools) fans.  
  
If you are wondering what all the recent bug mail was about, wonder no
more, for I shall explain. Thus.  
  
We're using only three different levels of importance for testtools
bugs: Critical, Medium and Wishlist. Critical is reserved for release
blockers: regressions, test failures and other disasters. Medium is for
genuine defects and other things that we think are important. Wishlist
is for everything else. I think of them as Critical, Important and
Someday.  
  
All of this is in preparation for the 0.9.8 release, which promises to
be a doozy. Â Stay tuned.
