The single most important thing we can do for Launchpad as a product is
make our own rate of development faster. I say this as a developer and
as the “product strategist”.

One large chunk of my responsibilities consists in talking with
development teams that use Launchpad and finding out what they need.
Almost every time I talk with them, I learn that their projects flow
much more quickly than Launchpad. As a developer, this makes me jealous.

As a product strategist, I see all sorts of little things in Launchpad
that need to be tweaked, and quite a few not-so-little things. When I
don't see them, people are often kind enough to point them out. Maybe if
Launchpad were much easier to change, then we developers would
spontaneously make small fixes more often. I know I would.

Maybe later I'll talk about what we can do about it, but for now I feel
strongly enough about the issue that it deserves its own post.
