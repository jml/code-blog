[Launchpad](https://launchpad.net) has been [open
sourced](http://blog.canonical.com/?p=192). That includes Soyuz and
Codehosting.  
  
I'm now a full-time free software hacker. Squee!  
  
Thanks to [Mark](http://www.markshuttleworth.com/) for making the call,
and to [Karl](http://www.red-bean.com/kfogel/) for being the flux
capacitor of the whole operation, humming along as we've built up to
1.21 gigawatts of <span>freedom power</span> and burst right through to
the future.
