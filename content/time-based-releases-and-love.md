I believe in time-based releases. I believe in frequent releases. I
believe in a trunk branch that is always ready to be a release
candidate. Many Free Software developers share my beliefs. For a long
time I haven't questioned it. It's obviously good to release regularly
and often.

Now I think I have to begin asking questions.  
  
Is it possible that time-based releases actually create negative
impressions of software? Should regular releasers slow down their
cadence? How should compatibility watersheds (format, API, whatever)
affect a release cycle? What would Bazaar's format reputation be like if
they released every six months instead of every month?
