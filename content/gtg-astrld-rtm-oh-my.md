[I love Astrid](http://weloveastrid.com/), and have really enjoyed
getting the four hundred tasks I have into it and synced with [Remember
the Milk](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/). I almost love [Getting
Things GNOME](http://gtg.fritalk.com/), and thought I'd experiment a bit
getting my tasks synced from RTM on to my desktop using GTG.

Unfortunately, I ballsed something up, and now all of my four hundred
tasks from RTM have been deleted. Sad. They are all still on Astrid
though. Happy. But when I sync from Astrid to Remember the Milk, none of
those four hundred tasks are uploaded. Sad.

If you know how I can get my tasks back on to RTM, can you please
comment here, or on the [question I asked on
Launchpad](https://answers.edge.launchpad.net/astrid/+question/110188).
