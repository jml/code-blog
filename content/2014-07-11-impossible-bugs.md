Title: Cutting edge debugging
Date: 2014-07-11

One of the great pleasures of advancing in one's craft is the thrill of solving 
newer, more difficult problems. In the course of my work, I frequently encounter 
many bugs which appear at first glance to be impossible. Not just impossible to
solve, but intrinsically impossible. It's as if being at the very frontiers of
technology exposes one to strange new logics that the human mind is not fit to
grasp.

Each of these bugs is, of course, unique, and it would be folly to suggest that
there could be any sort of _systematic method_ that could be applied at the
cutting edge of technology, as if one could push back the boundaries of ignorance
in much the same way as one fills in a tax return. Nevertheless, the following
principles have served me pretty well, and perhaps deserve a wider audience.


* You're editing the wrong file
* You're editing the right file, but on the wrong machine
* You're editing the right file, but you forgot to save it
* You've edited the right file, but you forgot to recompile
* The thing you thought you turned on, you actually turned off
* The thing you thought you turned off, you actually turned on
* You're in a meeting, and you should be paying attention. They wouldn't have 
  eighteen people talking about it unless it was really important, would they?
* You're running the wrong version
* You're running the right version, but on the wrong machine
* You've fixed the problem, but forgot to push
* You've fixed the problem and remembered to push, but you forgot to commit
* You've fixed the problem, committed, and pushed. However, many users were 
  relying on the previous, broken behaviour and so now you must roll back.


I offer up these principles humbly: no single approach can suffice at the very
fringes of the known. I earnestly hope that by meditating on them we can
achieve things as yet undreamt of.
