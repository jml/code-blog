Someone at Canonical (I don't know who) wrote something cool once to get
[Pyflakes](http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodPyflakes) (the best Python
linter)Â to run on doctests.  
  
It has recently been deleted from the [Launchpad
tree](https://code.launchpad.net/~launchpad-pqm/launchpad/stable), but
since it's so useful I thought I'd make it available.  
  
Download
[pyflakes-doctest](http://people.canonical.com/~jml/pyflakes-doctest)
whenever you'd like. If you can get it into Pyflakes trunk, then you'll
become even more wonderfully, deliciously fabulous and creamy than you
undoubtedly are already. Get rid of the Launchpad-specific stuff though.
