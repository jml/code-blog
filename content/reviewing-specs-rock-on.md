I just finished reviewing a bunch of
[LEP](https://dev.launchpad.net/LEP)s, which are the specs Launchpadders
write for doing new feature work. I've been looking at a bunch of the
[privacy](https://dev.launchpad.net/LEP/PrivateProjectsAndDistributions)
LEPs and one on [merge
queues](https://dev.launchpad.net/Code/MergeQueues/LEP). Â It's been
great to see such good, clear thinking, and also to see people thinking
and writing in terms of constraints and requirements ("What do we want?
Why?") instead of implementation or potential solutions.  
  
Basically I've got a bunch of scribbled-on bits of paper right now.
Tomorrow I'm going to update the wiki & schedule calls with the
developers so we can kick them along.
