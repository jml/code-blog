I bought a Nexus One. I got sick of not having any decent todo
applications for the Palm Pre, so I bought a shiny new Android phone.
Some quick thoughts:

<div>

-   Android has many apps, many of which are very cool
-   Buying an application is way too easy, given Google Checkout
-   I can't seem to get 3G data access from the Nexus One
-   WebOS has a much nicer UI for multi-tasking
-   Wonder if I can get on IRC via my SSH tunneled bip connection

**Update:** I now have 3G access, thanks to these instructions for
[getting 3G from O2 on Android
phones](http://forum.o2.co.uk/viewtopic.php?p=144262#144262).
