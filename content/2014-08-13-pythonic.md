Title: Isn't it Pythonic?
Date: 2014-08-13

I really should be over
[this](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.devel/93654/) by
now.

Here's how you test exceptions in Python 2.7 and later:

    :::python
    with self.assertRaises(SomeException) as cm:
        do_something()

    the_exception = cm.exception
    self.assertEqual(the_exception.error_code, 3)

(as recommended in the [unittest
documentation](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertRaises))


Here's how you test exceptions in earlier Pythons, using libraries
like [testtools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/testtools).

    :::python
    the_exception = self.assertRaises(SomeException, do_something)
    self.assertEqual(the_exception.error_code, 3)


I still like the second way. It's simpler, uses less code, and doesn't
rely on new syntax. I'm sorry it didn't work out that way.

I guess this is how [Barry](http://barry.warsaw.us/) feels about the
[diamond operator](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0401/).
