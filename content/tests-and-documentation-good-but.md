I've long held that doctests are no way to test code. Andrew Bennetts
explains the problems with [narrative
tests](http://bemusement.org/diary/2008/October/23/narrative-tests) and
why [tests are better written in code rather than
text](http://bemusement.org/diary/2008/October/24/more-doctest-problems).

Recently, the Zope developer community has started taking these ideas
seriously, and is [starting to change its testing
strategy](https://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zope-dev/2010-April/040160.html).
This can only be a win for them: better test coverage and documentation
driven by user needs.
