The [Launchpad Code home page](https://code.edge.launchpad.net/) is now
a little bit nicer and a little bit faster.  
  
For a while now, the page has had a tag cloud showing some projects that
host branches on Launchpad. The tag cloud is drawn based on the
following rules:  

-   The more branches, the bigger the tag
-   The more recent the last commit, the less faded the tag  
-   If Launchpad is <span>the</span> place to go for getting the
    project's code, colour it green. Otherwise, blue.  

Up until recently, the home page only showed some projects starting with
'A' -- which is a bit silly. My recent patch changed the query to show
the most branch-y projects on Launchpad. It looks a lot nicer, IMO.  
  
[Martin Albisetti](https://launchpad.net/%7Ebeuno) has asked me to
change the colours though. Expect an update soon.
