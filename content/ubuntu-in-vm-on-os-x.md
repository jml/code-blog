I'm trying to get Ubuntu 10.10 running in a VM on my iMac. It mostly
works with either VirtualBox or VMWare Fusion, but I can't get 3D
acceleration working. Under VirtualBox, I can get compositing happening,
but it's very slow. Under VMWare Fusion, Ubuntu won't even acknowledge
that I have a 3D card. Help.  
  
**Edit:** If you can point me to a *working* guide for dual booting
Ubuntu on the iMac 27", then that would also be great.
