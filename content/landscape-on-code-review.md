The Landscape guys mentioned three things that I've missed in [Your Code
Sucks and I Hate You](http://mumak.net/stuff/your-code-sucks.html).  
  

-   The important thing about code reviews is that they are a
    conversation. Emphasise this in your team's code review culture.
-   Don't speak to the person, speak to the code. "Why does the code do
    this?" rather than "Why did you do this?".
-   Remember that the person who wrote the patch is an expert in that
    patch.
