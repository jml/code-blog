It's way too hard to keep all of my music stored on one machine in a
lossless format, have it backed up to another machine, synced to my iPod
in MP3 and have it pleasingly playable on my OS X computer. Way too
hard. Really.  
Especially since fixes to track listings and so forth seem to vanish
like smoke in the breeze. Banshee and Rhythmbox both pretend to help,
but that's only so they can mess with my life more.
