You might already know that I have a lot of <span>lists</span> on my
computer. I may have mentioned once or twice that I have such lists.
These lists are connected to a certain popular productivity system which
isn't really about productivity and is a little bit like a cult.  
  
I might have also mentioned that I've been longing for a "smart" phone,
partly so I can have these lists with me at all times, to clutch at
reflexively like some Popish talisman.  
  
Now that I have a Palm Prē I have lists and a smart phone, and yet one
does not know the other. I am at a loss as to how to get my lists —
line-separated text files on my laptop — onto the Tasks application on
the Palm. Even then, once they are on the Palm, I have no idea as to how
to get them synchronized with something I can edit from my laptop.  
  
Any ideas?
