Didn't get around to posting last weekend, sorry. Next weekend I'll be
at a conference in the north of Tasmania, so no post then either.  
  
Things in the works:  

-   Automated testing as a community builder
-   Asynchronous functions
-   Asynchronous development methodologies

  
Also, [glyph](http://glyf.livejournal.com) thinks that xUnit sucks, but
hasn't bothered to explain why. So I want you to:  

1.  Tell me why xUnit sucks
2.  Hassle glyph until he does 1.
