I just read [Don't Make Me
Think](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dont-Make-Think-Usability-Circle-Com/dp/0789723107),
by [Steve Krug](http://www.sensible.com/). It's a good book. Sadly, I
read it over a fairly long chunk of time so a lot of the punch has been
spread out.  
  
Here are my thoughts about how we can apply some of the ideas to
Launchpad.  
  
**Tighten up our visual design**  
Launchpad doesn't look *too* bad, I don't think, but it could look a
whole lot better.  Doing that would cover over other sins, make people
more comfortable and is just the right thing to do.  
  
**Error recovery & undoability**  
We're not great at this. You can't rename teams, you can't rename PPAs,
you can't rename branches that other branches  are stacked on. You can't
delete bug tasks. Many forms just say "Invalid value" when you enter bad
input.  
  
**Keep up with the user testing**  
We do a fair chunk of user testing, mostly thanks to Matthew Revell. We
should do it more often, and more readily.  Also, we should wave some
kind of magic wand that makes it easier for developers to observe the
user tests as they happen.  
  
**Home page**  
Make it better.  
  
**Remove more stuff**  
Way too often in our design discussions, we talk about adding stuff to
the page: widgets, links, explanatory text. We should lean toward
removing before we add. Especially with text: fewer words. Be suspicious
when the solution to a usability problem is "more documentation".  
  
**Discuss things less**  
Sometimes, we really do talk too much about whether a thing should be
one way or it should be another.  Krug leads me to believe that most of
things we agonize about aren't actually the things that are important to
users.
