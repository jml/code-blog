Isn't talking shop *fun*? I know there's more to the world than
computers and programming and blah blah blah. Sometimes photography, the
election, real estate and the rediscovery of seventies pop music need to
be set aside to make way for a serious, meaty discussion on [anonymous
creation methods](http://xunitpatterns.com/Creation%20Method.html).  
  
I've been up in Sydney for a couple of weeks, working with the other
Canonical guys. I hadn't realised how much I missed working with other
hackers *in the same room*.  
  
Sydney has [good things besides
programmers](http://www.camposcoffee.com/), of course.  
  
Not exactly sure when I'll be moving, but it'll happen eventually.
