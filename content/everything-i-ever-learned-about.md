... I learned from [Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/).[1]  
  
Which reminds me, one of the Twisted guns is up for hire. His name is
[Itamar Shtull-Trauring](http://itamarst.org/resume.html) and he is very
smart, wrote some of the best bits in Twisted and loses gracefully at
[Munchkin](http://www.sjgames.com/munchkin/game/).  
  
If you want someone in to review your system, help you design out a
network protocol or provide a thoughtful, independent perspective for
your new application's architecture, you should hire him. Itamar's got
bad RSI, so he can't type much, otherwise I'd be trying to poach him.  
  
Note: Itamar still works for [ITA
Software](http://www.itasoftware.com/), so it's only short-term
contracting.  
  
  
[1] Well, [SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) gets a guernsey too.
