This blog is about code, programming, developer collaboration and my
technology woes. I have [another blog](http://life.mumak.net) where I
talk about pretty much everything else that I find interesting.

<div>

They are split up because a lot of the readers of [Echo and
Bounce](http://life.mumak.net) have no interest and little understanding
of the minutiae of Python hacking, and because [Mere
Code](http://code.mumak.net) is syndicated out to stacks of planets
where the readers probably don't care about [my thoughts on Puritans and
business yoga
probloggers](http://life.mumak.net/2010/05/book-of-you-and-dammit-list.html),
or [why I think garbage bins are so
great](http://life.mumak.net/2009/05/meditations-on-garbage-bin.html).

If you *do* find that sort of stuff interesting, I warmly invite you to
subscribe to my other blog, [Echo and Bounce](http://life.mumak.net), or
to my [combined RSS feed](http://mumak.net/planet/rss20.xml).
