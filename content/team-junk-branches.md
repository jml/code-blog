Very, very recently, we changed Launchpad to [support team +junk
branches](https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/launchpad-bazaar/+bug/237465).
So recently, in fact, I don't think the change has hit the servers yet.
Anyway, after the 2.2.3 release on April 1, you'll be able to push up &
create branches in lp:\~your-team-here/+junk/some-branch.  
  
I have to confess I'm not a huge fan of this feature. Almost all of the
time, if you've got some code in a branch and you want others to
collaborate on it you should [create a new
project](https://edge.launchpad.net/projects/+new-guided). That way you
can file bugs, do code reviews and get easy branch stacking support.  
  
Still, the use case that
[Jordan](https://edge.launchpad.net/%7Elaserjock) mentions is a good
one, and the fix fell out naturally from some of the work we've done for
source package branches, so we decided to do it. You see, we actually do
get a kick out of making our users happy. Really.  
  
I guess the moral of the story, if there is one at all, is to [file bug
reports](https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/launchpad-bazaar/+filebug). We
don't want to build a website with [separate bubble
domes](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1b/The_Homer_by_Carlos_Bisquertt.jpg)
and [three horns that all play "La
Cucaracha"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Brother,_Where_Art_Thou%3F)
so we aren't going to mindlessly say "yes" to everything. But we do want
to make something that will help you rock the Free Software world even
harder, and to do that, we need to know what you want.
