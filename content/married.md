I'm back online after three weeks vacation. Purpose of said vacation was
to get married and go on honeymoon. Only thing to say about that is:
huge success. I'm very, very happy.  
  
While I've been gone, Ubuntu has had its developer summit and decreed
that Ubuntu 12.10 will have only Python 3 on the CD. As such, a few
people haveÂ done a bunch of work on the
[testtools](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/testtools) cluster
([fixtures](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/fixtures),
[testscenarios](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/testscenarios), etc.),
making them Python 3 compatible, or fixing compatibility bugs where they
existed. It's such a nice feeling to come back from vacation and taste
the delicious fruits of other's labour. Well done all!
