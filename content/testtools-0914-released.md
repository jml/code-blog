[testtools](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/testtools)'s sister project,
[subunit](https://launchpad.net/subunit), was using a private API that
we deleted in the 0.9.13 release.  This release restores that API in
order to smooth out the upgrade path.  
  
If you don't use subunit, then this release won't matter very much to
you.
