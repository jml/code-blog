I know that many of you follow the [Launchpad Road
Map](https://dev.launchpad.net/RoadMap) with an interest so keen and
passionate that it can only be described as obsessive. Some of you might
fail to penetrate through its crusty, bureaucratic exterior to its
swirling, luminous core, and thus stumble blindly into the future,
heedless of the glancing rays that this document triumphantly casts on
*the road ahead*. If you are one of these benighted souls, then take my
arm and allow me to guide you on.

We're starting to get a picture of [what we want to do in the second
half of 2010](https://dev.launchpad.net/RoadMap#road-ahead). In
particular, lots of people within the team and within Canonical are
starting to get fed up with our privacy and permissions model, which is
quite patchy. It's currently tangled up with the way we send emails to
people, and we'd love to untangle them.

The [Foundations](http://launchpad.net/launchpad-foundations) team are
already at work making Launchpad faster, and that's something we want
work on even more in the coming months. Derivative distributions – that
is, a Linux distribution that extends or customizes another one,
generally Ubuntu – have always been a key part of the vision for
Launchpad, and they are finally going to get the effort they deserve.

Finally, we want to do whatever we can to make the [Ubuntu Software
Center](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoftwareCenter) rock harder than it does
already. Launchpad occupies a special place in the Software Center
world, since it can help make it easier to get applications for your
desktop *and* make it easier to develop those applications.

Glorious and radiant though it is, the light of the road map shines onto
the ever-changing territory of the future. We might discover new twists,
valleys might open up before us, vast emergences could … emerge. We'll
keep the map current, but it *will* change. If you wish to stay as
up-to-date as possible, [subscribe
