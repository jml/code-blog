Late last year, as part of my work at `Weaveworks <https://weave.works>`_, I
published `grafanalib <https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib>`_, a Python
DSL for building Grafana dashboards.

We use it a lot, and it's made our dashboards much nicer to maintain. I've
written a blog post about it that you can `find it on the Weaveworks blog
<https://weave.works/grafana-dashboards-as-code>`_.
