Have you tried [lptools](https://edge.launchpad.net/lptools)?  
  
It's not at all officially associated with the Launchpad project, of
course, but it's got a few nice things that you might want to look at,
including:

-   a milestone manipulator
-   a code review notifier, and
-   a milestone to iCal exporter

One of these days, I'd like for there to be an official, awesome
Launchpad command-line client. As it is, I'm happy with the world of
people making extensions to meet their needs.  
  
For other extensions, check out the [lpx
project](https://launchpad.net/lpx) or our [list of
clients](http://help.launchpad.net/Clients).
