At the Launchpad Epic, I presented a paper on Twisted for the other
Launchpadders. I think that the paper itself is a good introduction to
how Twisted works and why, and I'll be publishing it here once I get a
chance to format it for the web.  
  
I did two lightning talks that might be interesting to readers. One was
on [testresources](https://launchpad.net/testresources) and the other
was on how to hack like an Evil Overlord. I think I'll try present the
second one at OSDC.
