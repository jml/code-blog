You might remember I was really excited about the first version of the
active reviews page, since it let me see at a glance the code reviews I
needed to do, the ones I was waiting on, and reviews I could do if I
felt like it. At the time, this was really important, since it's the
first time I've seen a code collaboration tool orient itself towards me
actually doing things. It's certainly a first for Launchpad.  
  
Tim has recently landed a few changes to the page that aren't quite as
revolutionary, but follow the same lines of thinking.  
  
The one I want to mention is putting all the branches that are approved
for landing onto the active reviews page. Every branch that's approved
to land and hasn't yet landed is actually waste, it's an improvement
that's sitting around gathering dust and waiting for someone to push a
button. It's like a winning lottery ticket stuck to your fridge because
you're too lazy to cash it in. We think it's so important that we've put
these at the top of the list.  
  
You can take a look at the active reviews pages for:  

-   [Jonathan
    Lange](https://code.edge.launchpad.net/%7Ejml/+activereviews)
-   [Jonathan Lange in
    Launchpad](https://code.edge.launchpad.net/%7Ejml/launchpad/+activereviews)
-   [Launchpad](https://code.edge.launchpad.net/launchpad/+activereviews)
-   [Yourself](https://code.edge.launchpad.net/people/+me/+activereviews)

Now if you'll excuse me, I have branches to land.
