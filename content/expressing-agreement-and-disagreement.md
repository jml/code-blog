There's a habit within Canonical on expressing agreement and
disagreement numerically. If we agree with something someone says in
email or IRC, we'll often say "+1", which means "I agree!" or "if we
were to vote about this, you would have my vote". I sometimes hear
people actually say the words "plus one" in conversation.  
  
Some have extrapolated from this to say "-1" to mean "I disagree", which
is a pretty natural thing to do. However, it confuses me a lot.  
  
  

<div
style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">

You see, the "+1" thing is a little bit like the [Apache voting
system](http://httpd.apache.org/dev/guidelines.html), which I met in my
early days of open source, back when I lurked on the Subversion
development mailing list. The voting rules there were burned into my
mind, and I foolishly assume that they are equally fundamental to
everyone else.

In the Apache system, "-1" means "veto", which is a very strong way of
disagreeing. When people on the Launchpad say "-1", I never really know
what they mean. I don't blame them, "-1" is a bit of a silly way of
vetoing a proposal. I bet if keyboards had a key for ∞, there'd be a
much more sensible way.  
  
I guess the moral of the story is, "ambiguous shorthand is ambiguous".  
  
Incidentally, how does the Apache voting system work out in practice
these days?
