Yesterday I got back from the [Ubuntu Developer
Summit](http://summit.ubuntu.com/) where hundreds of people got together
to plan the next release of Ubuntu, the "Natty Narwhal".  
  
For Natty, the Ubuntu Platform team have five foci:  
  

1.  Unity
2.  2D Experience
3.  Software Center
4.  Testing
5.  Community contributions

We on the Launchpad team want to do everything we can to help Ubuntu
achieve these goals.  Partly, this will be by continuing to make
Launchpad a joy to use.  However we'll probably be able to offer some
specific help with the last three foci: Software Center; testing and
community contributions.

I don't know of any concrete actions yet – I've yet to trawl through the
many blueprints to find them – but for the next few months, I'm hoping
that Launchpad developers will be watching for opportunities to help
make Natty the best release ever.
