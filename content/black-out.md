I've been a bit slack and have yet to black out my website or avatar to

policy.

In case circumstances prevent me from doing so, please read the
[Internet Blackout Australia](http://www.internetblackout.com.au/)
website to see why it's so important. You might also want to read [Hugh

thoughts](http://blemings.org/hugh/blog/blosxom.cgi/2010/01/25#20100125a)
on the matter.
