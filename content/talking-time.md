I've been working on the Launchpad team for a while, with most of that
time being in Australia. Others in the team are in the US (red states &
blue states), the UK, Germany, Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, Serbia,
Lithuania and Thailand.

Here are some tips I've picked up for smoother online conversations,
particularly around scheduling.

-   Don't say "summer" or "fall". Say the month, or the range of months.
-   Say "my morning" rather than "the morning".
-   Use 24-hour time.
-   In real-time conversations, say "in 2 hours time" rather than "at
    10".
-   Always include the timezone. Avoid using local abbreviations (e.g.
    PST), instead use offset from UTC.
-   Better still, just give the time in UTC.
-   Know your UTC offset.
-   Use a timezone-aware [meeting
    planner](http://timeanddate.com/worldclock/meeting.html). You'll get
    the arithmetic wrong otherwise.
-   Say "Oct 7" rather than 10/7 or 7/10. Everyone speaks English, but
    not everyone uses your dialect.
-   The time that you end a meeting is more important than when you
    start it. Thoughtfully consider the timezones of other attendees
    when you are planning for & participating in meetings.

Violating these rules isn't a big deal, since people can generally
figure out what you mean. Following them, however, can speed things
along and sometimes even avoid tedious conversations.
