I was going to write a post about how knowing some abstract algebra can help you write clearer programs.

Then I saw Eugenia Cheng's excellent talk, `Category Theory in Everyday Life <https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/10768-keynote-category-theory-in-life>`_, which was a keynote at Haskell Exchange 2017.

It's excellent. She says what I wanted to say much better than I could, and says many more things that I wouldn't have thought to say at all. You should watch it.

The talk assumes very little technical or mathematical knowledge, and certainly no knowledge of Haskell.
