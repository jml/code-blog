I had a great time at PyCon 2010. The best part was definitely the
[Twisted
sprint](http://labs.twistedmatrix.com/2010/03/pycon-2010-sprint-report.html),
which gave me a long overdue opportunity to do some actual coding.  
  
Well, actually, I ended up spending a lot of the time organizing a
release and writing [process
documents](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/ReleaseProcess), so I
didn't escape management as much as I would have liked.  
  
Now I'm back, planning on doing the [Twisted 10.0
release](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4290) and working with
[didrocks](http://launchpad.net/~didrocks) to get better [Launchpad
integration](http://help.launchpad.net/API) with
[Quickly](http://launchpad.net/quickly), as my contribution to [Project
Awesome
Opportunity](http://www.jonobacon.org/2010/02/04/project-awesome-opportunity/).
