You might not know about Firefox smart bookmarks. They let you type
something into your URL bar like "twisted 2345" and have Firefox load
the Twisted bug page for bug \#2345. Lifehacker explains [how to create
them](http://lifehacker.com/387944/how-to-make-your-own-smart-bookmarks-in-firefox-3).  
  
Here's one to add for Launchpad branches:

you've added this, you can type 'lp twisted' or 'lp python' into your
Firefox location bar and get redirected to the branch page for Firefox.
Anything that works as part of an lp: URL will work here. Right now,
this only works on edge.  
  
<span>Update:</span>Firefox escapes any slashes you put into the URL
bar, which makes this much less useful.
