We've recently been getting a few bugs filed on
[testtools](https://launchpad.net/testtools) about compatibility with
various versions of Python. I really want to support as many versions as
I can, but I simply don't have them on my system.  
  
What resources are available to me if I want to set up a Hudson instance
or similar that runs testtools tests against Python 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7,
3.0 and 3.1? A Windows run would also be nice.
