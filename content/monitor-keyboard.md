I want to get a shiny new monitor and keyboard. The monitor is for
coding, writing docs, answering emails and watching films. The keyboard
is for same. They'll both plug into my Thinkpad X200 for now.

I'm tempted to get an Apple Cinema Display (but at such cost!). I don't
know what keyboard I want. I think that the DAS keyboard I have isn't
it.

Thoughts?
