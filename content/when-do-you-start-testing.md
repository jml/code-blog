Although I love TDD, I don't always use it for everything. I wrote a
Python script the other day to clean up my music collection, and I
didn't write any tests for it.  
  
Someone asked me, what's the trade-off? At what point do you start
writing tests?  
  
For me, it's at one of a few points:  
  

-   Somewhere between 100-200 lines of code I start feeling the need for
    tests
-   When I start feeling unclear in my head, I reach to tests to make
    them clear
-   If someone wants to work with me, tests instantly become mandatory
-   When I come back to some code after a while
-   When I notice my first bug

What about you? Do you always do TDD? Do you have any rules-of-thumb for
when you do?
