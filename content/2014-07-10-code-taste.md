Title: Taste in Code
Status: Draft

One of the joys of code review is learning that there are ideas one has about 
makes good code which are not universally shared. When these ideas have been
held for some years, it can be difficult to explain exactly why they are so
compelling.

This is an attempt to describe and justify some of the elements of coding style
that I feel most strongly about but struggle to communicate.

# Code in general

## If a routine has inputs, make them parameters

## Do extra work to use composition over inheritance

## 'if's are a smell

## Do very little work in constructors

## More data, less code


# Testing

## Avoid `setUp` 

## Avoid mocks

## Document why


# Principles

## Strive for local reasoning

## Uproot complexity

## Don't make me think
