Over the weekend I upgraded my laptop to [Ubuntu
7.10](http://www.ubuntu.com) aka "The Gutsy Gibbon".  
  
Obvious improvements include having Pidgin installed and a much superior
version of Deskbar. There's also a swanky new panel to actually control
display settings (dual monitor and all that jazz). Unfortunately, I
can't quite get it to work just yet. My 22" 1680x1058 LCD will just have
to sit there, gathering dust :(  
  
In another weirdness, all of my fonts are suddenly much, much bigger. I
had to resize everything down to 8 or 9 to make them sane.  
  
My [pretty Emacs](http://peadrop.com/blog/2007/01/06/pretty-emacs/) has
also stopped working, but that's to be expected. It's a third-party
package that hasn't yet been built for Gutsy.  
  
Other than that, seems to be a fairly routine upgrade. Is there anything
exciting that I've missed?
