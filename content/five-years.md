That's not quite how long it took [Glyph](glyf.livejournal.com) to write
a post explaining what he meant when he told me that [xUnit should use
the visitor pattern instead of the composite
pattern](http://glyf.livejournal.com/72505.html).  
  
I'm going to write a more detailed response later, God willing. I just
wanted to flag the post and say thanks to Glyph for finally posting it â€”
the [hassling](http://mumak.net/2007/08/20/let-the-beat-drop/) must have
worked.
