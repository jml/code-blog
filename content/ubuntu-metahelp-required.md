I just got back from UDS-M. If you've never been to a UDS, you probably
don't know what an intense, inspiring, fun, draining time it can be.

<div>

Anyway, I got back and started mucking around on my Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
laptop on my home network. Everything was great until – suddenly – the
wireless connection drops out. I have two other devices (Android, OS X)
that are connected just fine, so I know it's probably not a network
configuration issue.

I also have noticed this behaviour all the way through Karmic and since
the Lucid beta.

I want to fix this bug. I want this to be my personal contribution to
Maverick. I'm inspired, I'm *pumped*, but I don't really know where to
begin. I don't even know how to file a good bug about this.

</div>

<div>

That's where I need your help.
