It's not going to work, it's not the final release, but I'm very pleased
to announce that [Twisted
10.0.0pre1](http://people.canonical.com/~jml/Twisted) is available for
testing.

Download it, test it, play with it and help us make 10.0 the best
release ever!

On a side note, this is hopefully the start of a much simpler, more
automated [release
process](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/ReleaseProcess) and maybe
even time-based releases.
