As I mentioned earlier, I've just had a very productive and fun weekend
of hacking on [testresources](https://launchpad.net/testresources). But
why was it so good?  
  
<span>Fast Commits</span>  
  
Because I was working offline using Bazaar, I could make commits to
testresources and they'd be done before I could Alt-Tab back to Emacs.  
  
<span>Fast Tests</span>  
  
It takes about 0.15 seconds to run the test suite. This meant I was
running it all the time, which in turn meant that I was totally certain
about whether the code worked all the time.  
  
<span>Clarity of Purpose</span>  
  
I knew where I was and where I wanted to go.  
  
<span>No Rabbit Holes</span>  
  
The testresources code base is small enough that it is nearly impossible
to get distracted by <span>other</span> systemic defects. If there is
such a defect, it's probably the one that you're working on right now.
This might be another way of saying...  
  
<span>No Blockers</span>  
  
I wasn't waiting on anyone to do anything. There weren't any other bugs
that needed to get fixed before I could continue.  
  
<span>No Integration</span>  
  
The system is about as self-contained as it gets. No signals,
subprocesses or sockets: just Python. The only dependency is pyunit3k,
which is small, robust, well-tested and also pretty darn
self-contained.  
  
<span>No Interruptions</span>  
  
I wasn't answering questions on IRC, taking Skype calls, handling
incoming email, doing the washing, checking Facebook, catching up on my
blogs, watching a film or wrestling a bear. "Fast Commits" and "Fast
Tests" probably fall into this category too.  
  
In other words:  

> There is nothing except this. There's no art opening, no charity,
> nothing to sign. There's the next mission, and nothing else.
