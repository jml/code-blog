A thing I do all the time is:

<div>

-   take a screenshot of a window
-   open up GIMP
-   crop to the relevant parts
-   share the screenshot as a bug or email attachment

<div>

The "take a screenshot" step is actually:

</div>

</div>

<div>

-   Fire up GNOME Do
-   Type "s c r RET"
-   Select "Grab the current window"
-   Click "Take screenshot"

<div>

Is there a faster way of doing this? I particularly want to speed up the
cropping and grabbing steps.

</div>
