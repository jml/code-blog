*The Economist* occasionally publishes a "Big Mac Index" — how much the
world's favorite "burger" costs in each country, translated into a
common currency.  
  
Why they don't publish an index of how much an issue of the Economist
costs?  All of my issues have the price of the newspaper in lots of
Asia-Pacific currencies. A small sample:  

-   Australia, 9.39855 USD
-   Cambodia, 6.00 USD
-   China, 10.43655 USD
-   Hong Kong, 7.6917 USD
-   India, 5.0522 USD
-   Japan, 10.70535 USD
-   New Zealand, 8.6669 USD

  
Can anyone tell me why the price varies so much?
