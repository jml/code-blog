Instead of a junk branch, the auto packaging code now has [a proper home
on Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/pkgme-binary). I've filed bugs for
all of the things that I could think of that were wrong with it.
Actually, that's a lie. When I spot something wrong in code or behaviour
I make a note, usually a XXX comment. The bugs up there are the ones I
got from grepping my notes.  
  
Anyway, minor rant on effective use of brain and the gift of literacy
aside, I've also done a [reasonably detailed
specification](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutomagicBinaryPackaging). It's
been a long time since I've done a spec this technical & detailed, but I
hope it works out.Â If you have any comments or questions, ask here or on
the spec itself.
