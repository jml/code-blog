[commented](https://twitter.com/etrepum/status/1385947605) on how hash
functions need to be idempotent. I pretty much always interpret things
about functions and
[idempotence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotent) incorrectly.  
  
When used in computing, saying a function is idempotent generally means
you can call it a hozillion times and the state of the system (& thus
the return value of the function) will be the same as if you called it
once.  
  
When used in mathematics, a function <span>f</span> is idempotent if
<span>f(f(x)) = f(x)</span> for all <span>x</span>. The computing
quality of idempotence isn't useful since <span>f(x) = f(x)</span>.  
  
I would greatly appreciate it if we could all find a way to communicate
that didn't involve language.
