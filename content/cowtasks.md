If you've got a Palm Pre and you want to be able to synchronize tasks
from the Pre to [Remember the Milk](http://rememberthemilk.com), then

The original author has given up development, open sourced it and I've
put it on Launchpad. I don't have the time to maintain it either, but
I'd love it if someone did.
