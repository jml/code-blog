I'm reviewing my checklists right now. I just came across one that I'd
like some help with. It's called "Things every project needs", and it
currently has this:  

-   TODO system (e.g. specs, trackers, text file, bzr difftodo)
-   Version control
-   List of dependencies
-   One step build
-   One step build-and-run-tests
-   One step build-and-run  
-   One step build-docs (API, testdoc, general docs, sphinx)  
-   Version information
-   License  

I hope you see the sort of thing I mean. I mean things you have to do
(or at least think about) when starting any software project.  
  
Can you think of anything to add?
