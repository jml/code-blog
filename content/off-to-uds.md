I can't believe it's already time to depart dear old London and head
across the Atlantic to participate in another
[UDS](http://summit.ubuntu.com/). Although "participate in" doesn't feel
like the right verb, does it? UDS is a frantic, electric whirligig of
meetings and conversations and decisions and on-the-spot calls, cool
ideas and grand hopes, energy and exhaustion. "Almost drown in" would be
closer. I'm looking forward to it, but I'm a little bit daunted. The
last one took more out of me than I thought I had.  
  
To make my own life easier and satisfy whatever stalkers I may have been
fortunate enough to accumulate, I thought I'd post now about what
sessions I'm planning on going to at UDS:

Of course, I'll probably be going to sessions other than the ones I've
mentioned above. Sessions about how to design applications well or how
to write code for Ubuntu One always catch my eye.

However, my job is about improving developer collaboration – that's
pretty much the whole point of Launchpad. So any session about
development tools, development process or interactions between different
groups of people always take precedence. I'm at UDS to listen and to
learn, and to contribute what little I can.
