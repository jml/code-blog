Over the weekend I read [Cary
Millsap](http://carymillsap.blogspot.com/)'s excellent paper [*Thinking
Clearly About
Performance*](http://method-r.com/downloads/doc_details/44-thinking-clearly-about-performance).
In it, he hijacks the [UML Sequence
Diagram](http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/sequenceDiagram.htm)
format by drawing the vertical axis to scale. The bigger the gap between
lines, the more time was taken performing that interaction. Suddenly,
the sequence diagram can give you a clear picture of where time is being
spent.

Wouldn't this be a useful diagram to draw instead of [value-stream
maps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_stream_mapping)? You would lose
the easy distinction between "value generating" and "waste" steps, but I
think you'd gain a deeper understanding of hand-offs and of system
complexity. Drawing it to scale would give a helpful picture of where
time is being spent, and where response time can be improved.

More generally, Lean folk should probably read Millsap's paper and think
hard about what it means for software engineering process.

Also, I reckon drawing up a quick sequence diagram would be a great way
of seeing how deep one is in
[yak-shaving](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving). Each time you
go one layer deeper, add a new column and draw a new arrow and make a
note of when & why.
