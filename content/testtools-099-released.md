[testtools](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/testtools) 0.9.9 has been
released today. For me, the twin pillars of this release have been our
[vast documentation
improvements](http://readthedocs.org/docs/testtools/en/latest/) and [the
new
matchers](http://readthedocs.org/docs/testtools/en/latest/for-test-authors.html#matchers),
which make it very, very easy to make meaningful assertions about
complex objects. Well worth checking out.
