Here's my problem. There are a bunch of languages I want to explore more
(Clojure, Haskell, Go). I've wanted to do this for some time. I haven't
done it. I've [mentioned this
before](http://code.mumak.net/2012/02/bad-snake-joke.html).  
  
At it's simplest and most fundamental, this comes down to poor
self-management stemming from an inaccurate personal vision. That is,
"If it's important, you'll find a way. If not, you'll find an excuse."  
  
But, setting aside deep-level character hacking, there's got to be
something to make this easier. Part of the problem is that Python is so
smooth, I've been with it so long and most of the technologies I want to
interact with have a strong Python component. Any time I have an itch
that needs scratching, Python is the comforting abrasive of choice. I
can do whatever it is about 10x faster with it than with another, new
language.  
  
Perhaps all I need to do is gird my loins and prepare myself for the
confusion and time expenditure that comes with

anything
[new](http://code.mumak.net/2012/06/unfiltered-reflections-on-my-first-juju.html).  
  
Gentle reader, do you have any tips for escaping the Python gravity well
and exploring languages unknown?
