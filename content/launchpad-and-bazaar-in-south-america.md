Just got back to Australia after a couple of weeks in Brazil and
Argentina.  
  
Three big things:  

1.  This year, we are going to rock hard on Bazaar.
2.  We are finally looking seriously at [improving Launchpad's
    performance](http://news.launchpad.net/launchpad-performance-week/introducing-launchpad-performance-weeks)
    across the site.
3.  The Code team has a lot to do, and not much time to do it.

More later.
