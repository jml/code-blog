[As I mentioned](http://life.mumak.net/2008/12/version-control.html) on
[my other blog](http://life.mumak.net/), I really struggle to explain
version control to non-programmers. In particular, I don't know how to
communicate just how <span>cool</span> it is.  
  
[Rands](http://randsinrepose.com) has a go at it by explaining that it's
all about [capturing
context](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2006/03/23/capturing_context.html).
How do you explain Bazaar (or anything other version control) to the
people you meet?
