[Rob](https://launchpad.net/%7Elifeless) has landed my overhaul of
[testresources](https://launchpad.net/testresources). testresources is
now a lot cleaner, with more tests, more documentation and fewer
classmethods. If you've looked at it before and found it a bit
confusing, now is a great time to have a fresh look.  
  
The
[NEWS](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/%7Elifeless/testresources/trunk/annotate/18?file_id=news-20080828110236-ku9h8n676vfwcwad-1)
file,
[README](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/%7Elifeless/testresources/trunk/annotate/18?file_id=README-20050904000703-ba3978635caa34f7)
or
[TODO](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/%7Elifeless/testresources/trunk/annotate/18?file_id=todo-20080817122443-kaikqdedcg57lr4v-1)
are all great places to start. Or, you could just download the
[branch](https://code.edge.launchpad.net/%7Elifeless/testresources/trunk)
from Launchpad. 'bzr branch lp:testresources' should do the trick.  
  
There's still so much I want to do, but this has been the big step:
getting a firm conceptual base to work from.
