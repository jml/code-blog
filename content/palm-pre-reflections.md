I got a Palm Prē yesterday. Here are some initial thoughts.

<div>

-   I like the feel of the physical device
-   The keyboard is small
-   Camera is useless for taking photos of receipts
-   The gesture UI is great
-   The Mail application shows individual emails, rather than
    GMail-style conversations. Lame.
-   I don't know how to get my lists out of text files on my computer
    and onto the Palm
-   I don't know actually know anything about syncing from the Palm
-   I still don't regret not getting an iPhone
