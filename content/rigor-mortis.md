I've been on a bit of a sanity bender recently: science, logic,
evidence, experimentation, clarity and things like that. Here's a short
list of some of the things I've been reading:  
  

-   [Harry Potter and the Methods of
    Rationality](http://hpmor.com/) (H/T mwhudson)
-   [Straight and Crooked
    Thinking](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Straight-Crooked-Thinking-Robert-Thouless/dp/1444117181)
-   [Pretotype It](http://www.pretotyping.org/) (H/T lifeless)
-   [Lost Tools of Learning](http://www.gbt.org/text/sayers.html)
-   [Hard Facts, Dangerous Half-Truths and
    Total-Nonsense](http://www.amazon.com/Facts-Dangerous-Half-Truths-Total-Nonsense/dp/1591398622/) (H/T
    lifeless)
-   [Puzzling outcomes in A/B
    testing](http://glinden.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/puzzling-outcomes-in-ab-testing.html)
-   [Politics and the English
    Language](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm)

  
If you're writing software then I recommend "Pretotype It" first,
because it's likely to make you write *less* software, and that can only
be a good thing. They are all great reads though.  
  
There are a few general themes: be explicit about your assumptions and
try to verify or falsify them as soon as you may; do experiments; beware
of certain mistakes or logical short-cuts; learn statistics; understand
what you are saying. Wonderful notions all, but I'm not sure whether
they are working out for me.  
  
Occasionally I'll get an email that has a couple of sentences but
somehow manages to squeeze in all sorts of conflations, non sequiturs,
and general fudging. It's hard to know where to begin. I can make a fair
stab at analyzing the errors, but synthesizing a response that actually
*helps* is very hard.  
  
Rigour also puts a restraint on rhetoric. It's hard to say something
convincingly when you have a bunch of qualifiers dangling at the end. My
writing (even now!) is slowed down as I notice the unfounded assertions
and unstated assumptions that lie behind it.  
  
Also, much of this doesn't help you get from a vague, interesting
intuition to a workable idea, from hunch to hypothesis, if you will.
Sometimes a notion needs to time to grow before it's rejected as
irrational or incorrect. Something like [Thinking
Hats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Thinking_Hats) can help here.  
  
This is all peanuts though. Do more science. Really.
