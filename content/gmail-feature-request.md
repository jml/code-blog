First, where should I make these requests?  
  
Second, I'd like to be able to open my GMail without seeing all the new
mail in my inbox. Very often, I open up GMail just to look up some fact
that I've forgotten, or to put a date to a particular event. Seeing new
mail and an unempty inbox distracts me, leading me down a rabbit hole of
processing.  
  
I guess a GreaseMonkey hack wouldn't be *too* hard.
