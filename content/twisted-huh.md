One of the hallway conversations I've had a few times so far at
EuroPython goes like this:  
  
A: Twisted's got some good stuff going for it, but I don't like the way
it forces me to use Zope interfaces. It's too heavyweight?  
B: Huh? What do you mean? It doesn't make you do that.  
C: Yeah, there's lots of deep inheritance, which just feels really
wrong.  
A: Right, I have to write too much code to get something simple
working.  
B: Sorry, I have no idea what you mean. Can you give a concrete
example?  
A, C: I can't think of one right now.  
  
To me, this is a very intriguing beginning to a real conversation. Do
you know what A and C might mean here? I'd love to understand their
points so that I can form an opinion.
