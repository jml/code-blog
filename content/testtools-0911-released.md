While I slept, [Robert Collins](https://launchpad.net/~lifeless)
released [testtools
0.9.11](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/testtools/0.9.11). This release is
mostly a bug fix release, but the fixes are very much worthwhile.  
  
In particular, [Martin [gz]](https://launchpad.net/~gz) got our Python 3
support going again, [Gavin Panella](http://gavinpanella.com/) fixed up
a dodgy Matcher and fixed a bug in how we feed information from fixtures
into test results.  
  
Also in this release, [Tim Cole](https://launchpad.net/~tcole) and
[Martin Pool](http://sourcefrog.net/) made their first ever patches, for
which they have my hearty thanks and congratulations. (The
congratulations are also hearty.)  
  
As always, it's just so darn *pleasant*Â to see so many fine people
working together to make an open source project work.
