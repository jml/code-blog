I spoke at [EuroPython 2009](http://www.europython.eu/) in Birmingham
about the [unittest](http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html)
module in the [Python standard
library](http://docs.python.org/library/index.html).  
  
The central thesis was first proposed to me by Robert Collins, probably
around 2003 or 2004. The idea is that unittest is actually surprisingly
good and more extensible than you think. It was also Rob's idea to
co-present this as a talk in Birmingham. Sadly, I was obliged to present
it by myself.  
  
I'd like to write up the talk more thoroughly, and am keen to publish
brief posts on why layers are bad and why setUpClass is bad, but for now
I'll just post the artifacts from EuroPython.
