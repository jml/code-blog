I like unit testing a lot. I've recently been thinking about whether it
really is everything that advocates like myself make it out to be. I'm
still thinking, but I reckon that language has something to do with it,
and that I wouldn't like TDD so much if I were writing in Haskell.
Maybe.

Anyway, here are the benefits of unit testing, without justification or
explanation:

<div>

-   Easier to maintain code
-   Avoiding regressions
-   Make API clearer, both by describing it and by encouraging
    contracts.
-   Confidence in changes to code

<div>

For new contributors, there are other benefits:

</div>

<div>

-   Confidence in changes to code
-   Confidence in the validity of your own patch
-   Mechanism for exploring internal system behaviour

</div>

Some of the costs are:

</div>

<div>

-   Maintaining tests
-   Caring about the performance of tests
-   Running the tests
-   Debugging tests

<div>

For new contributors, there are other costs:

</div>

<div>

-   Finding tests
-   Figuring out how to run tests
-   Figuring out how to write tests
-   Learn unit testing

</div>

<div>

Is this fair? Is this clear? And exactly where was that post by that guy
about unit testing being overrated?

On a half-related and slightly exasperated note, many of the
conversations I've been having recently have been about costs and
benefits. What happened to doing something because it was the right
thing?
