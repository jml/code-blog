If I don't dump a bunch of stuff that's on my mind, I'll never blog
again. Here goes:

</div>

-   Launchpad users within Canonical seem to appreciate the
    [Roadmap](https://dev.launchpad.net/RoadMap). Still receive some
    complaints about not communicating our plans enough, but not sure
    what to do.
-   Team lead meeting in London went well. Good to see the gang again.
-   The Wellington sprint was amazing. Rarely seen a sprint that's more
    productive.
-   My favourite result: a fixed, pre-planned annual schedule of
    sprints, including *two* annual whole-team sprints. I get to meet
    with my colleagues *and* have a life and Canonical saves money all
    at once.
-   The team leads like the
    [Ready-to-Code](https://dev.launchpad.net/ReadyToCode) and
    [Launchpad Enhancement
    Proposal](https://dev.launchpad.net/LaunchpadEnhancementProposalProcess)
    process things.
-   Daily builds work is going well. There's a lot of UI bits to
    consider, and we're trying to get the UI correct before building it.
    Grates my JFDI nerves, but maybe it's the right approach.
-   Challenged the Launchpad team leads to blog once every two weeks
    about anything, as long as it's vaguely related to Launchpad. The
    name of the challenge? Blog like it's 2006.
-   [Community Help Rotation](https://help.launchpad.net/HelpRotation)
    sucks and basically no-one really knows what to do about it.
-   I'm cautiously excited about using kanban to track our
    work-in-progress.
-   Launchpad needs graphs in the Launchpad application. I think all we
    need is someone to just add one. I don't have the time to do it as
    part of my day job, and I've got a backlog of other hacking tasks.
    Could I help you do it instead?
-   I'm going to PyCon.
