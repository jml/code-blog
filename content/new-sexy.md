My new shiny iMac 27" arrived today. It is very beautiful, although the
screen is dauntingly large. When the [Kanex XD
thingies](http://kanexlive.com/products/item-id-3662.html) come out,
I'll be able to plug my XBox into it too.

It's the first time in a long time I've done a fresh install of a
non-Ubuntu computer though. Some things, however, remain the same.

<div>

1.  Download decent browser (Firefox or Chrome)
2.  Download IRC client (for OS X, Colloquy)
3.  Generate SSH key
4.  Upload SSH key to server, register it on
    [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/~jml)
5.  Change the default Terminal settings to light grey text on a
    translucent black background
6.  Get Emacs

<div>

Oh, and to forestall questions, I'm not going to dual boot right now but
I plan to eventually.
