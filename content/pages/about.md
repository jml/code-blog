My name is Jonathan Lange. I'm a programmer who lives in London.

If you are interested in software development, open source, Python, Haskell,
unit testing, functional programming, vague ramblings about process, then this
site is for you.

I also have a more [personal blog](https://life.jml.io/). I don't update it
very often at all.
