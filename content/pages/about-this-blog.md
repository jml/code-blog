Hello, my name is Jonathan Lange, and this is my technical blog.  
  
On this blog, you'll find discussion about Python, unit testing,
programming in general, vague sorts of ramblings about process, attempts
at figuring out better ways of doing things, announcements of releases
of software, and probably some other things.  
  
I also have a [non-technical blog](http://life.mumak.net/), which you
might find interesting.
