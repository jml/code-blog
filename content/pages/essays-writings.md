[Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Twisted](http://code.mumak.net/p/everything-you-always-wanted-to-know.html)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This paper was originally prepared as an introduction to Twisted for the
Launchpad development team, and was presented in London on October 30th,
2008. The version here has been edited a bit, but is essentially the
same paper. Co-written with Michael Hudson.  

[Your Code Sucks and I Hate You](http://code.mumak.net/p/your-code-sucks-and-i-hate-you.html)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Written for OSDC Sydney 2008, this paper talks about the social dynamics
