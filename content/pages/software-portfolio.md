Slug: software-portfolio

I'm a programmer. I've made and contributed to an awful lot of software
that's available on the web, mostly Open Source.

Here's a partial list.


Software I made
---------------

Software of which I am the primary author or co-author.

### [graphql-api](https://github.com/jml/graphql-api)

[GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) server in Haskell.

GraphQL is a compelling alternative to REST.
This library, inspired by [servant](https://haskell-servant.github.io/)
and implemented together with [teh](https://github.com/teh),
allows you to write GraphQL services in Haskell.

I wrote most of the "validation" code,
which translates the AST into something that can be executed.

### [haskell-spake2](https://github.com/jml/graphql-api)

Implementation of the SPAKE2 key-exchange protocol in Haskell.

Derived from warner's [python-spake2](https://github.com/warner/python-spake2)
and intended for use with [magic-wormhole](https://github.com/warner/magic-wormhole).

### [grafanalib](https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib)

EDSL in Python for building Grafana dashboards.

### [testtools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/testtools)

Tasteful unit testing for Python.

Created together with Robert Collins.
I no longer play much of a role in maintaining it.

### [treeshape](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/treeshape)

Creates files and directories on disk in a declarative way.
Great for testing code that does disk I/O.

### [difftodo](https://github.com/jml/difftodo)

Neat little tool that looks at diffs of arbitrary source codecode,
finds any comments with XXX, FIXME or TODO and then formats them nicely.

Has Emacs integration, so you can treat XXX comments like compiler errors.

I have ambitions to turn it into a web service.

Projects I have contributed to
------------------------------

### [Cortex](https://github.com/weaveworks/cortex)

Highly-available, horizontally-scalable time series database for Prometheus,
developed by [Weaveworks](https://weave.works).

The brain-child of [Tom Wilkie](https://github.com/tomwilkie),
I mostly play a guest starring role, but I'm proud of contributing.

### [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/)

Still the best way to do networking in Python. Twisted was first open
source project I got involved with. I learnt so much from the other
contributors.

I haven't contributed much recently, but back when I was more active, I
did a lot of work on Trial, Twisted's unit testing framework.

### [subunit](https://github.com/testing-cabal/subunit)

Protocol for streaming test results. The foundational technology for
[testrepository](https://launchpad.net/testrepository), and extremely
useful for gathering interesting data about tests.

### [testrepository](https://github.com/testing-cabal/testrepository)

Wonderful little test runner that stores past results and uses those
results to parallelize test runs in the most efficient manner.

When you use it to run tests, it shows you the delta of failures, number
of tests and time taken to run. This is a little thing, but makes a
powerful difference to the TDD cycle.

### [pkgme](http://pkgme.net/)

Make Ubuntu packages for your project automatically.

### [python-fixtures](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fixtures)

Resources with clean up that you can compose and re-use without buying
into an entire framework. Â That said, they do work exceptionally well
with [testtools](http://testtools.rtfd.org/).

### [pyflakes](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes)

What used to be everyone's favourite Python lint checker.

### [Bazaar](http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/)

One of the earliest distributed version control tools and in many ways
the most pleasing to use. I wrote a lot of the Launchpad integration.

### [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/)

Huge, ridiculously ambitious open source collaboration platform:
tracks bugs, hosts code, manages translations, and builds Ubuntu.

I wrote large chunks of the code hosting system,
and have messed around lots with its testing infrastructure
and the chain of tools around building packages.

For a while, I was also the product manager. When I was, I tried to make
sense of
[what Launchpad actually is](https://launchpad.readthedocs.org/en/latest/scope.html)
and
[what its strategy was](https://launchpad.readthedocs.org/en/latest/strategy.html).

Scraps
------

Little tools that I don't spend much time on, because they meet my needs and
they don't have many users.

### [txapply](https://github.com/jml/txapply)

Provides a way of using Twisted's `Deferred` objects like they are applicative functors.

Lets you use an arbitrary function to combine arbitrary `Deferred` objects.

### [testdoc](https://github.com/testing-cabal/testdoc)

I dislike Python's [doctest](https://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.html),
for reasons best explained by Andrew Bennetts:
[narrative tests are lousy tests](http://bemusement.org/narrative-tests) and
[tests are code, doctests aren't](http://bemusement.org/doctests-arent-code).
People kept telling me that doctests were are great way of getting
documentation for free when writing tests. So, I wrote a cheeky little tool
that analyzes Python unit test modules and turns them into readable
documentation. This is it.

### [hodor](https://github.com/jml/hodor)

todo.txt compatible command-line client, written in Haskell.
