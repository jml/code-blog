Up in Brisbane, while I was diligently working away on package branches
in Launchpad, many of the Bazaar guys were working on their new
"brisbane-core" format.  
  
I overheard one of them say in this new format 'log -v' is up to twenty
times faster.  
  
Want more details? Well, perhaps someone else on Planet Bazaar can
provide them.
