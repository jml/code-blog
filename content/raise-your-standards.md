I gatecrashed LugRadio Live last Saturday and went to an excellent talk
by Matthew Paul Thomas about reporting usability problems. Matthew has
reported [well over a thousand bugs against Launchpad
itself](https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/launchpad-project/+bugs?field.searchtext=&orderby=-importance&search=Search&field.status:list=NEW&field.status:list=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status:list=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.status:list=INVALID&field.status:list=WONTFIX&field.status:list=CONFIRMED&field.status:list=TRIAGED&field.status:list=INPROGRESS&field.status:list=FIXCOMMITTED&field.status:list=FIXRELEASED&assignee_option=any&field.assignee=&field.bug_reporter=mpt&field.bug_supervisor=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=&field.omit_dupes.used=&field.omit_dupes=on&field.has_patch.used=&field.has_cve.used=&field.tag=&field.tags_combinator=ANY)
(many of which [have been
fixed](https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/launchpad-project/+bugs?field.searchtext=&orderby=-importance&search=Search&field.status:list=FIXCOMMITTED&field.status:list=FIXRELEASED&assignee_option=any&field.assignee=&field.bug_reporter=mpt&field.bug_supervisor=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=&field.omit_dupes.used=&field.omit_dupes=on&field.has_patch.used=&field.has_cve.used=&field.tag=&field.tags_combinator=ANY))
so he knows something about the subject.

Matthew gave six pointers on how to report usability problems, but for
me the single most striking one was this:

<div style="text-align: center;">

**Raise your standards**

</div>

  
When you are using an application with the aim of improving its
usability, you need to shed all of your tolerance and forget those many
workarounds you've learned. Drum your fingers impatiently while you wait
for something to load. Think of how this would look if you were showing
it to a sceptical friend.

<div>

The point struck me because so many times as an application *developer*
I've thought to myself "it's good enough" or "it will work for now".
Really though, that's not good enough. I should work until the thing
I've added is invisible, or at least fun to use. I need to raise my
standards.

</div>

Having raised one's standards, the trick is then to avoid the traps of
perfectionism. Do you have any thoughts on how to walk the road,
avoiding the pitfalls, standards held high?
