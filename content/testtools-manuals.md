I wrote a whole pile of documentation for
[testtools](https://launchpad.net/testtools) over the weekend. You can
read it [here](http://mumak.net/testtools/docs/).  
  
I would very much appreciate it if you could read over the docs there
and tell me if anything is unclear, wrong or otherwise unhelpful.
 Telling me what's good would also be appreciated.  
  
Please leave whatever feedback you have either as comments on this post
or on the [merge
proposal](https://code.launchpad.net/~jml/testtools/more-doc-improvements/+merge/42045).
