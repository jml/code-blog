As you might know, [Launchpad has a code review
system](https://help.launchpad.net/Code/Review). You might have even
given it a try a few months ago when it first came out. We, the
Launchpad team, started using it almost right away and to be completely
honest with you, we didn't like it very much. On the whole we are
curmudgeonly engineers who would rather fix bugs or build features than
fiddle with a silly website. However, now the much-feted power of
[<span>dogfood</span>](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000012.html)
was working for us.  
  
We've been improving the code review system for <span>ages</span> now.
It's[not
perfect](https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/launchpad-bazaar/+bugs?field.tag=code-review),
but is getting better rather quickly. Over the last cycle, it has
started to become <span>really good</span>. We've [done a lot of things
this
cycle](https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/launchpad-bazaar/+bugs?field.searchtext=&orderby=-importance&search=Search&field.status%3Alist=FIXCOMMITTED&assignee_option=any&field.assignee=&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_supervisor=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=&field.omit_dupes.used=&field.omit_dupes=on&field.has_patch.used=&field.has_cve.used=&field.tag=code-review&field.tags_combinator=ANY),
I want to focus on [one in
particular](https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/launchpad-bazaar/+bug/325985),
since it's dear to my heart.  
  
On our [cutting edge servers](https://edge.launchpad.net/), and in the
next release, the "active reviews" page for a project is tailored to you
specifically. Instead of just showing you all the reviews, like it used
to do, it shows you the following lists:  

-   The reviews you <span>must</span>do. That is, the reviews
    specifically requested of you that you haven't done.
-   The reviews you <span>can</span> do. Reviews that have been
    requested of your team that no one else has done yet.
-   The reviews you are <span>waiting on</span>. Reviews that you've
    requested that haven't been done yet.  
-   The reviews you have <span>completed</span>. Reviews you've done
    that haven't been replied to yet.
-   Everything else.

It's the first list that makes me happiest. At last, I have a list of
reviews that I can churn through, knowing that I'm doing the right
thing, not having to figure what state it's in or make decisions about
how important it is. I simply <span>do</span>.  
  
The second list is pretty awesome too. If ever I'm between branches or
have a few minutes to spare during a lengthy test run, I have an
already-prepared list of ways to make other people happy. That's the
kind of software I like.  
  
And, well, actually, I like the third list too. It's great to be able to
look at the things you are blocked on and see who you need to hassle.
The "Waiting For" pattern comes from GTD, and is one of the best things
about the system and deserves wider notoriety.
