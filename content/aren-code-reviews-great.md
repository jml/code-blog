Ben Sussman-Collins writes about [programmer
insecurity](http://blog.red-bean.com/sussman/?p=96) and how a lot of
programmers dread having others see their code.  
  
Some of the [best](http://jcalderone.livejournal.com)

[I've](http://radix.twistedmatrix.com) [worked](http://sourcefrog.net)
[with](http://glyph.twistedmatrix.com)
[are](http://python.net/crew/mwh/) in love with code reviews, and all
great writers have editors. (The "linked list" is in no way exhaustive.)
Personally, I see reviews as being a great opportunity to learn.  
  
Sussman-Collins also writes about how distributed version control can
exacerbate the "isolated genius" problem by shielding ones code from the
public eye. This is definitely a big potential drawback of DVCS, but one
that's largely mitigated by a culture of short-lived branches and [an
easy-to-use public registry of all branches for a
project](https://code.launchpad.net).
