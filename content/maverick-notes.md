I recently upgraded to Maverick beta. Here are my thoughts and
observations:  
  

-   Despite the huge number of PPAs and unofficial debs I had on my
    system, the upgrade itself was very smooth
-   Everything looks much crisper, probably due to the
    [two](http://design.canonical.com/2010/08/an-update-to-the-ubuntu-light-themes/)
    [updates](http://design.canonical.com/2010/08/second-update-to-the-ubuntu-light-themes/)
    to the Light themes
-   Python 2.5 was removed. I work on software that still supports
    Python 2.4, so that's a pain
-   The keyboard indicator is nicer (I can read it), but it says "USA"
    when I want it to say "Dvorak"
-   The booting process is still flashes between screen resolutions,
    switches to black then back again
-   I still have to rmmod iwlagn; modprobe iwlagn sometimes
-   "Print to file" from Chrome produced a single blank page of PDF
-   I don't know how I feel about the Me & Message menus

I guess lots of these are bugs. They are, after all, easier to notice.
