Launchpad does translations. You can register a project on Launchpad and
use Launchpad to translate your software into a zillion other languages.
We've even got funky tools to take the translations that people do on
the web and commit them straight to your branch.  
  
As an ignorant Anglophonic monoglot, I've never really looked into
Launchpad Translations. Software is already written in my language, and
I can't help translate it into my language. There has been no reason for
me to look at it... until today.  
  
Barry Warsaw, hacker extraordinaire, has started a project called [I
have a colon full of
cookie](https://launchpad.net/colon-full-of-cookie). This project aims
to translate the phrase "I have a colon full of cookie" into as many
languages as possible. Note here that "colon" is the organ, not the
punctuation mark.  
  
OK, time to bust out my Latin lexicon.
