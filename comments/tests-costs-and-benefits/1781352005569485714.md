Yes - Language is very important in this debate. Test are more important
for dynamically typed languages (e.g. python), than for statically typed
languages (e.g. C\#.)  
  
For example, if you rename a method, and you don't change one of the
caller of the method (cause you missed it,) the static language will
pick this up at compile time, but with the dynamic language, if you
don't have tests, it's going to show up later as a bug.
