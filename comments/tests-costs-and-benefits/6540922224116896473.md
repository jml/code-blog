For me a major benefit is that you save time. I.e you don't have to
manually test something 100 times until it works correctly. You just run
the test and it should be able to automatically do the test in less time
than it would have taken to do it manually. With the added benefit that
you can redo the test in a months time without remembering exactly how
it works.  
  
Another advantage for me is that it gets you thinking about what exactly
you are trying to do before you spend the time going in circles of
implementation while you are still trying to figure out what you are
trying to do.  
Especially if you doing it right:
