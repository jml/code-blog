This isn't a moral issue, you won't go to hell if you didn't write any
unit tests. ;-)  
  
Something is the right thing if the costs outweigh the benefits. Unit
tests clearly add value to the process, and for me it's just as clear
that the value is greater than the cost. Most people at least agree that
testing (of some kind) reduces the time-spent-per-bug.  
  
I think the debate is really about the *opportunity* cost of unit
testing; could we be doing some BETTER form of testing, if we weren't
writing unit tests?  
  
For me, the answer is "maybe, but I haven't heard about it yet".
