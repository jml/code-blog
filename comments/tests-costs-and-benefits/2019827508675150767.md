Sure, you don't need as many of the unit tests in a language like
Haskell, because you can encode some of the constraints on behavior in
the type system and the compiler will handle ensure these.  
  
But, I almost think I would be more inclined to do testing of at least
the core structures and functions of my applications if I were in
Haskell because in fact it sounds like it is easier. With tools like
QuickCheck and HPC and some more advanced checkers as well, there is a
large toolkit to do so.  
  
I recently have been re-reading Real World Haskell and Chapter 11
Testing and Quality Assurance
(http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/testing-and-quality-assurance.html)
makes me feel like the cost vs benefit ratio is definitely more bang for
buck.  
  
I also remember watching a talk by Don Stewart (and perhaps another of
the xmonad developers, I can't remember right now) about the development
of xmonad and the testing that went on. It was very enlightening.  
  
I feel like I'd be more prone to catch the TDD spirit (well, more
correctly the attitude that the code isn't done until it is tested)
while using Haskell than I have been using Python. I have not, in fact,
got into TDD in Python because it does seem onerous.
