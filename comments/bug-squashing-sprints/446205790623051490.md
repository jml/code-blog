I think part of the problem is that two sprints a year is too few. On
the Landscape team we do things a bit differently: we have 4 sprints a
year and each one is 2 weeks (so maybe they're more like marathons). We
distinguish planning sprints from coding sprints and generally
interleave these two things.  
  
We've aligned our development process with Ubuntu's 6 month cycle, so
this works quite well. We get together at UDS for a "planning sprint"
where we work out what we want to accomplish in the next six months.
When we get home we all start working on whatever features have been
discussed. These sprints are also a great time to review development
process and other non-coding aspects of the project.  
  
Typically in the middle of the 6 month cycle we have a "coding sprint".
These sprints are usually about moving forward whatever tasks we've been
working on, but sometimes they focus on other things like getting the
client prepared for release, or stabilizing code that's been undergoing
a lot of churn.  
  
We divide these 6-month cycles into 1-month milestones. One of the ways
we deal with bug accumulation is to explicitly use the 6th milestone as
polish/bug fix time.
