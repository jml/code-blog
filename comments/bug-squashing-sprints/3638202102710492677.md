Debian do this with their Bug Squashing Parties (BSPs). When approaching
a release they run these to get the number of RC bugs down.  
  
http://wiki.debian.org/BSP  
  
I agree that this could be a good use of sprints. For instance, bzr
currently has 1733 open bugs, around half of those ever reported and
more than are marked "Fix Released." That's quite a lot of pain points,
though I feel many were transient, since fixed or extreme edge cases.  
  
[ Hey, this would be a better conversation if LP produced graphs of
these numbers over time. ]  
  
Bugfixing often requires you to do feature work, or at least
re-architect some area, so discussions around the best way to do this
would be good for sprints.  
  
Also, there is a question of how to pick the bugs, for Debian it is
quite easy, there is a list and all must be dealt with, what should
other projects do? Work from the top of the list down in terms of
priority?  
  
I think it would be good if tags were used extensively, so you could
look at all the bugs related to “dirstate,” or “log,” and try and fix
swathes of bugs in one go. Also, if all bugs had executable test cases
then you would get TDD for free.  
  
Or, in short, “I agree.”  
  
Thanks,
