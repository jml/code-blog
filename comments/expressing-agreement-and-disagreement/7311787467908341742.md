I don't have any experience of voting numerically outside of Canonical,
but I have never considered -1 as a veto, except where unanimous consent
is sought (but I can't remember being part of a vote like that). By that
I mean that it has never even occurred to me! My assumption has always
been that *agreement = sum(votes) \> 0*, with +0 and -0 being a
non-influencing way to express inclination.
