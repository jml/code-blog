For bzr, we always required no -1 votes, which lead to the -0 vote. (I'm
against this, but not enough to block it.)  
  
Of course, we also had the +0 (I think it is interesting, but not sure
it should be accepted.), etc.  
  
Though we switched to words pretty quickly. I still really miss the
"BB:tweak" vote. (Land it with some small changes.)
