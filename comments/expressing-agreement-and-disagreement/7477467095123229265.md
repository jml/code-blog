A quick read through of the apache rules says -1 is a veto only if
consensus is required. While we like consensus, we don't seem to require
it on LP, if there's broad agreement and a few holdouts. So in that
context, the -1 makes sense as disagreement.  
  
But largely, I agree with deryck; I've seldom seen -1 used as veto in
practice.
