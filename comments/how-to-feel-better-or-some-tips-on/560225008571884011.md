As to point 7, I'd say that "with care" is not quite good enough. Change
the test, run it, it should pass; but then always go change the
implementation in a way which should break the test, and make sure it
still fails.  
  
If we had really good coverage tools which were constantly informing us
in a useful way of which lines were being run, with good IDE
integration, this step might not be necessary, but even the snazzier
IDEs I've seen do not seem to have this down.
