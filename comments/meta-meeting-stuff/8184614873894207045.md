FWIW, we deliberately scheduled an hour of "unstructured" time into each
day.  
  
Mary, although I can't speak for the others, you describe exactly how
I've felt at these things in the past, and yes, it is draining. Although
I can't think of any right now, perhaps there are more considerate ways
of handling this than opening up your laptop.  
  
Full disclosure: I also had my laptop open inappropriately at some
points of the meeting, and bear absolutely no ill will towards anyone
there who did the same.
