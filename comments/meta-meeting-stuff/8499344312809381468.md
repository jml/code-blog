Re email checking, I don't know exactly how you set it up, but maybe
there's an introversion problem with these sprint meetings.  
  
You get a bunch of people, many of whom (I think) work from home.
They've travelled, they might be sharing a hotel room, they're spending
all day having high stakes, high bandwidth face-to-face interactions.
They socialise all evening. They sleep. They go round again. It may be
pretty draining especially compared to their usual quota of human
interaction.  
  
So it may be that some of them are trying to create some downtime for
themselves by laptopping. I don't have a good solution given the expense
of these meetings.
