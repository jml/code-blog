In your description of expectedFailures:  
*A list of tuples of (test, error\_message) for all of the tests that
were expected to fail, where test is an ITestCase and error\_message is
a string suitable for display to humans, generally containing a
traceback.*  
  
There is some ambiguity. I think you mean that it is a list of tests
that failed in the expected way, rather that tests that were expected to
fail (whether or not they actually did fail that way).
