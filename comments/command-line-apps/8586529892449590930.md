This seems like the kind of thing a bounty would be good for, actually.  
  
I'm generally pretty sceptical of bounties: "here's \$200 to do \$3000
worth of software development, oh, and we'll haggle over standards just
as much as we would if we were paying \$3000." But this sort of task
strikes me as fairly well defined, unlikely to blow out significantly in
estimates, a bit low priority and unexciting for core volunteers,
potentially high impact in terms of users.
