Thanks bignose, I hadn't heard of that one. I'll take a look at it.  
  
I agree that a progress bar is separate from a command-line parser, but
it's not separate from a command-line app toolkit. I could have made my
point better, but what I meant is that Bazaar has a great command-line
app toolkit begging to be separated from the dvcs bits.
