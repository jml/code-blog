Dammit. I wrote a reply which then got lost.  
  
Here it is again, from memory.  
  
Jamu, as I said, I've only ever had a fairly shallow look at Commandant.
Here are a few things from skimming the README:  
  
\* I don't want to have to use shell aliases to have my program be
called by its proper name.  
  
\* I dislike the idea of putting files in a directory to get commands.
I'd much rather an explicit registry.  
  
\* I don't want the word "Commandant" appearing in the output of my
program.  
  
Maybe what all of this means is that I was looking for a library, and
the README makes it look more like a framework. This is all rather
shallow, of course, since I still haven't actually tried to use it in
anger.  
  
Hope this helps.
