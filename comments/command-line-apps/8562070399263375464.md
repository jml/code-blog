I want to add support to Commandant for command aliasing (which implies
some kind of configuration file handling), progress display and plugins.
I'm not sure what you mean by 'error handling', but at present
Commandant displays str(exception) when an exception is raised by a
command.  
  
If you have any advice on how to make it easier to figure out what
Commandant is for, I'd love to hear it. Also, thanks for publicizing
Commandant!
