5 hours! Wow!  
  
5 minutes is too much. To run some tests between code edits, 50s is
really pushing it.  
  
My preferred method of development is to run the one test or TestCase
that exercises the code I'm working on, and trial has no problems doing
that. When I think I'm fine with that, then run the entire test suite.
Does Launchpad lack a good way to do that?  
  
If I can't make-a-change-run-a-test in about a 10 second cycle, there's
something wrong with my development environment and I won't rest until
it's fixed ...
