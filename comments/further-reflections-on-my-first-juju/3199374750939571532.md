Jono, thanks so much for spending time with juju, its really great to
hear some fresh new thoughts (and to have a few old problems reiterated
so we remember to address them.)  
  
For the feedback loop, I think the 'debug-hooks' command is going to
save you a lot of problems at least in terms of being able to run your
hook over and over until its "right". The problem is that unlike a test
suite, we are changing the system state \*on purpose\* so iterating
means getting back to the same starting state. I do think we need to
make better use of LXC's ability to clone containers in the debug-hooks
command, but network complexity becomes an issue, so we'll have to keep
working on this.  
  
Also for colorized logs:  
  
juju debug-log | ccze -A  
  
The ccze tool's general rules will produce a pretty nicely highlighted
log for you. The ERROR issue remains, but I think we'll solve that soon
enough with the patch you submitted. :)
