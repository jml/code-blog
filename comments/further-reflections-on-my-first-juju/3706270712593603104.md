@clint-fewbar, thanks for the 'ccze' tip. That's very useful, and not
just for juju charming.  
  
@Kapil, thanks. I discovered replay and log level filtering pretty early
on. The log level filtering was a bit annoying as -l ERROR didn't give
me *all* the errors, included some non-errors, and didn't provide enough
context for the errors that were included.  
  
I'm not really sure what an agent is or how it matters.
