Thanks for the comments, Vegan.  
  
I'm sorry you had a bad experience trying out Launchpad.  
  
Not sure what I can say about different projects having different
interfaces. We've made it a bit better recently, but there's still a way
to go, particularly wrt downloading files.  
  
On making a project, there's a "Register a project" link on the front
page of Launchpad. If you ever want to try again, that's the place to go
to.
