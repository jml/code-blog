I think those are all good points.  
  
I think being able to Undo a project (Deleting it) is very important.
Talking to various GitHub users this seems to be something that they
like a lot, where Launchpad's project creation feels heavyweight. Not
because it's got a larger form (it's got a few more, but not that much),
but because if you create a project it'll be there forever and you need
intervention from another human to get it deactivated. I realize we have
+junk (worst name EVAR), but that's not quite as useful as a lightweight
project.  
  
It'd be great to have the hypothetical dashboard as the homepage for
logged in users.
