In my humble opinion the single biggest problem with the launchpad site
is that the UI is awful.  
  
You frequently show way too much data on a single page, making simple
tasks harder (can't find the information amongst all the clutter), and
hard tasks just as hard. Think about the typical use cases for most
users, and optimise for them. Hide the advanced data somehow, and make
improvements for things users do all the time, rather than things a few
people do rarely.  
  
Now, I don't want to get down on you, since I really do love launchpad -
it's a great service (the best avilable, i think), but I suspect that
you need to take a step back from the UI and consider how a new user
might view it. It's a difficult task, especially for power users (which,
almost by definition you must be) of the product.  
  
Oh, and when I say "you", I mean... you know... launchpad developers...
or whoever is responsible.
