A couple comments about my launch pad experience.  
  
1. The interface changes too much from project to project.So I can never
find the download link, many projects don't even have one. Which means I
leave the site without the software.  
  
2. I tried to create my own project in Launch Pad. I've done it in
Source Forge. In Launch Pad, I literally couldn't figure out how to
start a project and add my code to it.
