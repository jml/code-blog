Thomi, I wouldn't say "awful", but there's definitely a lot of work to
be done. And you're right, it is hard: both because it is tricky,
uncertain work that requires careful judgement and because it's simply a
lot of work.  
  
However, without wanting to make too many promises, it's something that
I'd like to tackle in 2011.
