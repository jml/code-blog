I'm not sure I agree on all of this - why does build-and-run-tests need
to be one step? Why can't distro packagers take care of build-and-run?  
  
Here's a few more though.  
  
- Documented build-run-tests-upload-release. (Maybe this is why you need
build-and-run-tests? I still disagree that it absolutely must be one
step.)  
  
- Documented release announcement procedure. (Unlikely to get this down
to one step though because there are many places to announce a project,
not all of them belong to you.) Basically, [this
document](http://wiki.goonmill.org/HowtoReleaseHypy).  
  
Releasing should be done *early and often*. Therefore, it must be easy.
