*Are all of the steps in the process really needed? Why do we have so
many tarballs? ... Why generate a PDF?*  
  
As a step along the way to simplification, I think that perhaps we
should answer these questions explicitly, and not just as a rhetorical
device where "why..." means "let's not...". :).  
  
In fact, generally speaking, *every* step in the release process should
include an explanation of why it's necessary. Why do we run
\`change-versions\`? To update the version number in a mechanical way so
that we won't miss any instances of it. Why do we sign the tarballs? To
provide a way for distributors to verify that the release they've got
was the same release we released securely. Even the "quote of the
release" ought to serve a purpose, if it involves work for the release
manager! That way, if something else in the process changes, we have a
good way of looking at any particular step and saying "in light of these
changes, does it still serve its intended purpose?"
