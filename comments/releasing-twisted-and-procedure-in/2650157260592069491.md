One thing that I've found useful in release automation is \*not\* to try
too hard to automate things that should be done by a human. In places
there will be parts of your process such as "post the release
announcement to a newsgroup" or "comb through the bug list for notable
release notes".  
  
In those places, just make it as easy as possible for a human to do it.
For example, when I'm looking for release notes, I wrote a script that
extracts changesets and groups them by bug number, dumps that into a
text file and then shows me an xterm with the summary, and another
window where I can type in my release notes.  
  
Not automated, but \*easy\*.
