I was mainly thinking of how the scala implicits implementention give
you somewhat more control over type class instances.  
  
But in general, being an OOP/FP hybrid it gives you some tools form the
OOP end of things that provides some extra options.  
  
Full H-M type inference had to be sacrificed to get OOP though, but the
inference is still pretty good.
