If you're thinking of revisiting lisp, I urge you to take a look at
Racket, the latest incarnation of PLT Scheme. Racket gives you the
opportunity to work with pretty much all the best tools and paradigms
modern programming languages can offer (dynamic typing, static typing,
functional, OO, declarative), it is reasonably performant (optimizing
JIT compiler, optional type declarations) and though not as hype as
Clojure, it has a small but active and very mature community.  
  
Go is great, but I'm finding it hard to give up the dynamism, especially
interaction.
