Learning new things is great and no one should get themselves in a rut.  
  
Have you tried Vala? GObject introspection in a C3/Java-like language
that pre-compiles to C. It hits that start-up time problem you

more Python-like and which uses the same libraries and compiler. You may
want to start there.
