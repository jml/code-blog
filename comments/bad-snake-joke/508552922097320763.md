@Tom, I'll take a look at Racket. When I last looked at PLT Scheme, my
main take-away was disappointment in its module system.  
  
@glyph, it's *kind* of a good thing. It's arguably a great thing for the
end users of my work. If the way out of Python's boredom is to run
through some other language's minefield, then, umm, yeah, no thanks.
However, I'm not convinced that every other language will necessarily be
more dangerous/frustrating/slippery/difficult.  
  
As for going further up the stack, it's definitely an option, but not
one that immediately appeals.  
  
@Daniel, I haven't tried Vala. Does it do much beyond Java / C\#?  
  
@ddaa, I'm glad I'm not the only one! That I'm bored after twelve or so
years rather than, say, consumed by loathing, is a good sign. I look
forward to hearing more about your project.
