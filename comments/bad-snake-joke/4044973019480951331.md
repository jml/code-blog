I humbly submit that being bored with the language is kind of a good
thing. Maybe you should be looking further up the stack for some
excitement? Do something with PyGame, maybe? Or learn something about
bioinformatics and mess around with BioPython?  
  
To put it a different way: when I was doing C++, I felt a range of
emotions about the language and my tools for dealing with it, but
"boredom" was not one of them.  
  
(That said, Twisted *really* needs to make it easier to utilize multiple
cores.)
