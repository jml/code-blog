I've got the same problem. I'm in ;-)  
For me this only happends with Atheros Chipsets. Especially the AR5001X.
Compiling madwifi and blacklisting ath5k/9k only helps a little. I also
tried ditching NetworkManager and using /etc/network/interfaces for
configuration. That didn't help either (wireless performance/stability
still way below jaunty).  
  
That leaves me with the conclusion that this a kernel issue. The exact
same drivers (madwifi) work nicely in jaunty.
