Blogger claims you posted this almost 7 hours from now. Is it perhaps
set to show timestamps in Tasmanian time?  
  
Anyways, first step is to identify the culprit: you could try looking
through syslog to see if the driver's making a fuss about anything, if
NetworkManager got fed up, dhclient not getting enough love, etc.  
  
Does restarting NetworkManager help anything? (sudo restart
network-manager)  
  
Does reloading the driver help?
