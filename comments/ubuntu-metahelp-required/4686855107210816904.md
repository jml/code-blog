I'd begin by testing the latest mainline build at
http://kernel.ubuntu.com/\~kernel-ppa/mainline/v2.6.34-lucid/ (2.6.34
has a sufficiently more interesting WiFi stack). See also
http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Documentation/Reporting\_bugs (note
that the kernel wiki pointing to Ubuntu doesn't really contain useful
information if you're already testing 2.6.34 as recommended).
