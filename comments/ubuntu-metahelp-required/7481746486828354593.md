Well, I've got the relevant chunk of the syslog.

Dan, I'd feel uncomfortable trying out a new version of the kernel
without having a way of reproducing the bug or any understanding of what
is actually causing it.  
  
Mary, at UDS I sat in rooms full of those people. They really are quite
nice once you get to know them. I'm hoping that with this bug, I can
understand it deeply enough that the calls to retest won't seem as
arbitrary.
