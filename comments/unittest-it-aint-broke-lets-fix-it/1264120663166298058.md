I think we need something that glues together slides and audio. Now,
they do not interact and it is not fun to follow this presentation that
seems very valuable.  
  
What presentation gurus say is that the handout is different document
from the speech and different from the slides also. It is a third
document which needs its own hours of design and tuning.
