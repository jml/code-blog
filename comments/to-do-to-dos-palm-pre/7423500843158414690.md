I'm in the same cult. I don't know if the Palm Pre is a device that
allows you to install whatever you want, but I'm in the same situation
with my N800 and soon N900, plus my various laptops/desktops.  
  
I started writing a couchdb-based GTD manager (currently command-line
only, inspired on yagtd which I've used for the last two years). I plan
to port it to the N900, which should be doable given there are couchdb
packages.  
  
Not entirely what you're looking for, but let me know if you are
interested (or anyone else here, like tekNico)
