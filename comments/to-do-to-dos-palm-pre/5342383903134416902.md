@intellectronica, EverNote is on the Palm, but AFAICT it isn't a task
list manager, it's more of a note gathering application. Am I missing
something?  
  
@drewpca, Cool! Although, I think I'm interested in getting stuff
\*into\* Tasks, not out of it.  
  
@thomasvs, I hadn't heard of yagtd, I'll have a quick play with it. May
I suggest taking a look at GTG? Someone has a desktopcouch branch of
that -- it might be worth combining efforts rather than making yet
another GTD app.
