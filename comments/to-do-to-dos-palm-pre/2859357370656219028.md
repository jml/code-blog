mmm.. maybe somebody can port Bazaar to the Palm PrÄ“ :)  
  
I have a similar problem with my G1 (also a thinkingrock user). Thinking
about it, it should be possible to do the version control part from my
laptop when my phone is mounted. TODO: find a text editor which can edit
files in a branch on my phone.
