Hey Dustin,  
  
That sounds like a good idea. What command do you use to rsync, exactly?
I get a lot of permission denied errors when I try.  
  
A little poking around shows that the Tasks app is backed on to an
sqlite3 database. As best as I can tell, the schema lives in
/usr/lib/luna/PalmDatabase.db3 and the db itself in
/var/luna/data/dbdata/PalmDatabase.db3. That last one wasn't rsynced
when I tried with 'rsync -avPx'.  
  
Looks like tables for a bunch of apps are in there.  
  
Interestingly, the 'Task' table (com\_palm\_pim\_Task) has a column
called 'extraCrap'.
