\> I reckon drawing up a quick sequence diagram would be a great way of
seeing how deep one is in yak-shaving. Each time you go one layer
deeper, add a new column and draw a new arrow and make a note of when &
why.  
  
I love this idea. I'm going to try it out. I'm deep enough in my current
projects (both at work and at home) that this will be a non-trivial
diagram.  
  
If it provides any useful information, I may share this with my team as
well. Thanks!
