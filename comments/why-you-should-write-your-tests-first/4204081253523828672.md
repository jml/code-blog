I've been flip-flopping a lot on this. I probably do more TDD than not,
but there are still scenarios where I just can't start off with tests.
Usually, it's because I either don't understand the problem well enough
yet, or because the testing infrastructure work needed is pretty big,
and I can't bring myself to spending so much time upfront on it.
