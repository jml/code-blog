The point that I enjoy the most about writing tests first is that it
breaks the task down into a lot of mini-successes: write test, run code
to show failure, add functionality, run test, success! For me it makes
it a bit more like a game where you're always trying to reach the next
level which is just out of reach.  
  
Without writing tests first, it's more like a long wait until a
(potentially) big success, followed by many small failure moments as you
start finding bugs.  
  
But I agree with Martin... when I'm unsure about which way to go,
*sometimes* a tracer bullet helps me see how I can test.
