Thanks for the comments everyone.  
  
Julian, if by prototype you mean "proof of concept", then I also often
don't do that TDD. What tends to happen with those is that the prototype
*becomes* the tests. (After all, how did I know it worked?).  
  
  
Glyph, I would love to write up a more detailed version of this post.
It's unlikely I'll have the time.  
  
A thing that can help with untested mocks & stubs is "interface
verification tests": one set of tests that runs against the real thing
and against a more easily testable thing.
