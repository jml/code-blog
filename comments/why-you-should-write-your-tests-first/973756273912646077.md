Whether you do TDD or code-and-cover it's very important to make sure
your test fails when the code you think it is testing is broken (or
gone). Doing TDD ensures this fail-when-broken check happens for each
test. This validation can be performed with code-and-cover, but it is
much more tedious.  
  
I prefer TDD but use code-and-cover when I really don't understand what
I need. In that case, the code-and-cover I do is to (1) spike until I
know what I want and then (2) comment out my code and TDD until it's all
uncommented and covered properly.
