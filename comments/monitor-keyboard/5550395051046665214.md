I'm looking at monitors as well for my x200. At the moment this IPS
panel seems to be getting good reviews and is a reasonable price (NEC
EA231WMI-BK). Here's a good review of it:

It's 1920x1200, but I haven't checked it will actually work with the
x200 yet. Also 23" might be a bit big for the office ;-)
