I personally really like Unicomp keyboards which are basically Modern
manufactured IBM Model M Keyboards. They're clicky (which may not be for
everyone) but this provides excellent feedback and means you don't have
to hit the keys so hard as you do with rubber dome keyboards. See

On the monitor front I'm just looking into what's available myself. Top
of my list is the Eizo 2243 which is a 1920x1200 screen (PVA panel with
overdrive) in a 22" format alternatives to that would be Dell u2410 or
HP2475. Both of those are IPS panels with the same 1920x1200 but 24"
diagonal.  
  
All of the above are higher quality panels for greater colour accuracy
and better viewing angles and should be similar quality or better to
Apple's Cinema displays.
