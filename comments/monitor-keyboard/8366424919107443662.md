I just bought a BenQ full HD 21" monitor for almost nothing (NZ\$250)
and I'm pretty happy with it. It's not perfect by any stretch, but for
coding it's fine. For watching films you might want to spend a bit more
I guess.  
  
My keyboard is from "that keyboard and mouse company" -- a Microsoft
Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000, and I quite like it. I definitely
prefer split keyboard but I know some people hate them...
