I have a proper diNovo Edge and I love it to bits. Great tactile
response, really slim (I like flat keyboards, but that might be a
personal taste). It doesn't have a keypad which for me is a massive
plus, but I realise for others may be a problem. Also, not cheap.  
  
I also recently bought a Dell ST2410 24". It's probably the nicest
monitor I've used. Really good colours. All the proper HDMI connections
etc. Probably a good choice if price is at all an issue.  
  
Hrm, might sound a bit over positive, but they're probably the best two
bits of hardware I've ever bought.
