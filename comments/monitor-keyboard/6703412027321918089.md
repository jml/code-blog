I'm tappin' away on a [Logitech diNovo Laptop
keyboard](http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/keyboards/keyboard/devices/4742&cl=au,en)
at the moment. It's a wonderful piece of kit, if expensive.  
  
As far as displays are concerned, I'm not sure that the end result is
worth paying the Apple tax compared to other brands. Do your homework.
