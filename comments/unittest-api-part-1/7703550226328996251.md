Aaron, an *instance* of TestCase is a single test.  
  
When you have many test\_ methods on a TestCase, what actually happens
is that one TestCase object gets constructed for each test method.  
  
Say you've got:  
  
class TestFoo(TestCase):  
def test\_a(self):  
pass  
def test\_b(self):  
pass  
  
(please forgive the lack of indentation.)  
  
Then the default test loader will construct something like:  
[TestFoo("test\_a"), TestFoo("test\_b")]  
  
Thanks for asking the question. It's a common point of confusion.
Indeed, it tripped me up the first year or so I was writing Trial.
