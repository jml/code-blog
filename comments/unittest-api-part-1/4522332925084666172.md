Thanks for the comments all. I'm glad you like it.  
  
Michael, once I'm finished with the series and have a chance to get some
more feedback – particularly from other framework authors – I'll try to
turn these into patches. (And also try to get over the fact that I won't
be able to use zope.interface to do so).  
  
Your plugin proposal is up there on my list of things to respond to, but
I likely won't get a chance until the weekend.
