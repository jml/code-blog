I sure agree with you, I was just pointing out that telling people "not
to write doc is OK" is not OK.  
  
Also, I have abandoned for long the idea that I could write code easy to
understand. It may be possible for self-contained code, but any
interaction with a library, an API, or an external application will
result in some kind of stupid error management (like POSIX you mention).
That's why you need tests too :)
