Yeah.  
  
I'm a huge believer in putting code clarity above everything else, and
think good code design can do a lot to reduce the amount of
documentation you need, much like a well-designed product doesn't need a
massive user manual.  
  
Still, I'm simply bewildered that people can say "My code is
self-documenting" with a straight face. Maybe if it's a really small
sample of code.
