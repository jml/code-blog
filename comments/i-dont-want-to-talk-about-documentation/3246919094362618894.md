*If not, take pride in your lack of code documentation! It is the direct
fruit of you doing better things with your life. Stand up, walk out the
door an skip down the street, clutch the first suit-wearing stranger you
see by his lapels and shout "My code is under-documented, yippee
ki-yay!"*  
  
I couldn't disagree more. Because once you're in the street, there is a
good chance that you get hit by a bus. And then, the person hired to
replace you (let's face it, we won't mourn you forever), will have to
take over your undocumented piece of crap, and it will take him months
to understand your APIs because of the lack of documentation.  
  
Also, admitting that yourself in 6 months is not the same person today,
you're making him a big favor by documenting your code. That is, you.
