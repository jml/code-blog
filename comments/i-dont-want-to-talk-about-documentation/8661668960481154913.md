First, I'm not against documenting code. I'm against documenting code
without knowing why you are doing it.  
  
Second, you are conflating "documenting code" with "making code easy to
understand". Only the second one is valuable in itself. The first is a
means to that end, and only one of many.  
  
Did you read past there?
