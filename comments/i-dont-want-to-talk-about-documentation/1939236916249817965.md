I agree. If documentation is helping you delight your customers, then
add it; otherwise you are wasting your time and should feel ashamed
rather than proud.  
  
So documentation could help you satisfy your customers by  
  
1- directly helping them: developers are attracted to the Apple platform
because they feel it has good consistent developer-oriented
documentation, whereas Ubuntu's tends to be inward-looking and patchy  
  
2- making you more effective, by letting people get into the code or
letting them find conceptual bugs in the course of writing docs  
  
3- drawing in new contributors: perhaps the best way to satisfy this is
to update the documentation when a would-be contributor says "how do
I...?" or "what is the ...?"  
  
So in Launchpad, perhaps the most useful kind of technical documentation
is external API docs.
