Well summarised !  
  
You mention that in the case of disputed matters, the patch reviewer
makes the final decision in the case of Bazaar. It seems to me like that
usually when there is disagreement between the patch author and the
review(ers) the patch gets stalled and eventually the project leader
(Martin) makes the final decision.
