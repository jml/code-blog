Compositing works ok in Parallels.  
As for dual booting, it should Just Work with 10.04.1 or later - the
only non-standard wrinkles are:  
\* Install GRUB to the partition not the MBR  
\* Install rEFIt on the Mac so you can select which OS to boot.  
  
I'd ignore the Boot Camp tools as they are rather too focussed on
Windows.
