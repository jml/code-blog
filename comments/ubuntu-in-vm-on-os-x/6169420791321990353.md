Compositing works for me too in Parallels 6 -- if you're virtualizing in
OS X I strongly recommend Parallels.  
  
Note that when dual-booting, it actually doesn't matter if you install
GRUB to the MBR or the partition -- Mac EFI does the right thing (tm) in
either case, and you can't break your OS X boot anyway.
