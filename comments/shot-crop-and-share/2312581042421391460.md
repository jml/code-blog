I have a script (adn a Gnome Panel Launcher pointing to it) wich
executes this:  
  
cd \~/grabs && scrot -s %Y%m%d%H%M%S.png  
  
- Fire the script = Clik the icon  
- draw a rectangular on screen of the part you want to "shot"  
- upload it to your bugtracker easily by having a nautilus bookmark
pointing to \~/grabs
