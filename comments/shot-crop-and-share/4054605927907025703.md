scrot is a great command-line tool for such use.  
In particular, scrot -s allows to capture a full window by clicking on
it or a zone if you move before releasing the button.  
You can easilly make a small script to launch scrot with this option and
open the resulting file in a viewer. It can still be launched using
gnome-do if the script is in your \$PATH :)
