Thanks for posting this example. I've been struggling to understand
testresource (coming from PyUnit backgroun) and your third example is
the most helpful I've seen so far.  
  
One question- why do you say the database gets created and destroyed
*twice* in that example? If they're optimized, shouldn't the test case
that dirties the database be run last, then simply tear the db down at
the end of the test run- so only *one* invocation of setup and tear down
total?
