Sorry to be a bother, but I'm elbows deep in an implementation of
testresources currently, and I'm getting "TypeError: make() takes
exactly 1 argument (2 given)" in each test case (method of the
ResourcedTestCase class).  
  
I went back and reconstructed the 3rd complex example from your .py and
Storm, and I get the exact same error from testresources.\_\_init\_\_
(where I am getting it in mine). Does this ring a bell?
