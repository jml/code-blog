The functionality in bzr new is great, but I very rarely start a project
with a shared repo. Mostly, the branch comes first to see if the work in
a branch is even worth it.  
  
I was working on a similar idea of doing the shared repo and branch in
one command thing. My idea was more about branching the trunk of another
project into a shared repo. However, while I could get basic
functionality, I got blocked on cases where the branch format is
incompatible with the repo created, and found it difficult to check the
existing branch's format, to make a compatible repo. I've tried a few
approaches to no avail. :(
