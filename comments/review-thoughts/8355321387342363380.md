There were a few things that I realize were implicit in my last comment.
For one thing, I didn't make it clear how much I agree with the
experience you're espousing. I always copy review comments into an
outline buffer and delete each point as I deal with it, using it as a
nice to-do list with a built in progress meter. I actually find that
emailed diffs make this much harder to do.  
  
I also offered no specific criticism of the suckage of email and diffs.  
  
I find scrolling around hundreds of lines of un-annotated context
difficult, and (without reconfiguring my editor to use extremely loud
font faces) I find it easy to miss individual points, and I spend a lot
more time reading code that I wrote. I also find it very easy to get a
hunk of diff and have no idea what chunk of code it refers to without
scrolling around. Even without my aforementioned elisp, I find it a lot
easier to manually translate the string
"twisted.web.server.Request.render" into some file/line pair in my
editor than "@@ -187,7 +187,7 @@".  
  
Maybe this is because I prefer to work through reviews in issue order,
not in file order; i.e. if there's a problem with the structure of some
API, I will fix issues with the tests and the code at the same time.
