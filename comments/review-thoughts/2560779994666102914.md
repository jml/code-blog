So, glyph, vague comments do have \*something\* to do with the tools,
because with some technologies it's easier to be specific. Email quoted
reply, for example.  
  
I don't have anything as good as "jump to an FQPN". I do have etags
though, which is generally good enough.  
  
My own toolchain for navigating big emails could probably be better. At
the moment I use Gmail's "collapse quoted text" feature and that solves
most of my problems.  
  
The other big advantage of email (which you could get from other tools,
I guess) is that as the \*reviewer\* I can easily see which of my points
the author has replied to, and more importantly, which points they
haven't.  
  
Other points worth mentioning is that Launchpad tries to keep diff size
down (you need to specially arrange a reviewer if your diff is \> 800
lines). This probably has an impact on tool experience.  
  
I agree that something higher level would be much better. Perhaps we can
con Barry into writing such an emacs mode?
