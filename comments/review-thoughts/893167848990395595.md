I think that most of what glyph wants could probably be done with a
sufficiently advanced major mode for Launchpad style
review-amongst-quoted-diffs. Not that I'm going to write this any time
soon.  
  
One of the problems with the fancy web-based solutions -- have glyph or
jml tried any of them? I haven't -- is that you can't use emacs, of
course.  
  
I also don't have *all* that much experience with Twisted's development
process yet -- hopefully that will change soon :)
