You might be interested in Guido van Rossum's Rietveld. [1] You just add
the URL of your SVN repo, submit a patch, and tada: inline comment
reviews. We've been using quite happily with core Python dev. The only
annoying thing is posting your patch to the bug tracker and Rietveld,
but that could be negated with Trac integration.
