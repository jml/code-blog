glyph, certainly the diff format has a lot of problems and using
something richer that could provide more context would be better.  
  
But regarding cramming "the immense suckage of email into the already
sucky world of code review", I think you'd be surprised. By and large,
we find doing reviews email *less* sucky.  
  
Part of the reason is that you get a diff and a cover letter in your
inbox, you type your recommended changes next to the code that causes
them, then push a button that sends a review. It really is quite close
to what you describe in paragraph 3.  
  
I think that using numbers rather than bullets is definitely an
improvement, but you get essentially that for free with email quoting.  
  
If you can, you should contrive a way to experiment with doing reviews
by email.  
  
Also, fwiw, I'm not sure this is a Canonical-wide thing. I think
Landscape uses a system much more like Twisted's, for example.
