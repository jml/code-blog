I agree, and I hope that as the review facilities in LP evolve, we'll
grow something that leads users in this direction. One of the things I
really like about Launchpad is the (implicit, but nevertheless very
clear) approach of building an opinionated tool, a
there-is-only-one-way-to-do-it tool. Once we've identified a process
that works very well we should make Launchpad support this process and
no other. I don't know if Rietveld is the answer, but I hope that
eventually we'll have some kind of rich review tool that helps you do
the right thing.
