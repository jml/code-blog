Robert, I agree that taking an "optimize the inner loop" approach would
probably yield similar results to a value-stream-driven "optimize the
time between request and fulfilment".  
  
However, I'm not entirely sure it's guaranteed, and the Poppendieck's
repeatedly advocate "seeing the whole" and optimizing for it, and
frequently warn against micro-optimizing.  
  
By dividing things up into loops and cycles, I am explicitly ignoring
their advice. I can imagine that, actually, they'd approve of me doing
so.
