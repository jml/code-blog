We pretty much have the same set of cycles on the Landscape project,
with some having similar timelines. For example our planning cycle is 6
months, similar to Launchpad. I think our TDD cycle has a much faster
turn-around time than 30 minutes. It's more like 1 or 2, which is slower
than I'd like.  
  
Something I've been thinking about recently is a 2-3 year roadmap, a set
of high-level themes for the project that we use to guide our choices
when we make decisions regarding our planning cycle. My first thought
was that this was an outer ring that you didn't include in your post,
but I don't think that's quite right. It's more like the set of forces
that affect the direction in which the wheel is rolling.  
  
Also, I've been meaning to write this blog post for more than two years,
but have procrastinated and done nothing about this desire. Thanks for
beating me to it and describing the pieces so clearly.
