Robert Collins tried to comment on this post, but ran into technical
difficulties. He emailed me his comment, which I'm pasting here:  
  
I don't think Lean advocates would unroll everything - I wouldn't, and I
think I'm a Lean advocate. I'd treat the users request stalling at the
outside edge of each cycle, before it passes into an inner cycle,  
as a stall, and I'd try to break each cycle into little boxes so that I
could talk sensibly about how much time e.g. running tests. I naively
expect to see a similar conclusion if modelled this way - inner loops
that don't work well consume most of the duration of the vsm.
