I think all of those things are very good bits of advice, although I'd
perhaps have put them in a different order. The one I'd really like to
bash into people's heads is to either give times in UTC or local time &
UTC offset. I can never remember what EDT or PST and so on are.  
  
I would also say:  
  
\* be careful talking about days, particularly when close the date
line. My Tuesday is not the same as Jamu's Tuesday, or at least not for
very long.  
  
\* DST sucks bright red donkey balls.
