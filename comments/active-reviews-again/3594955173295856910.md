I'm very happy they're all now on one fridge, not stuck in the bottom
drawer.  
  
https://code.edge.launchpad.net/bzr/+activereviews  
  
The first three headings  
  
"Approved reviews ready to land"  
"Requested reviews I can do"  
"Reviews I am waiting on"  
  
all sound pretty clear  
  
"Reviews I am doing" presumably means it is somehow stuck to me like the
tar baby. I don't know how to get things off this list - I already voted
on them.  
  
"Other reviews I am not actively reviewing" is just a long way of saying
"Other". I'm not sure what I should do with these things. I'm waiting on
them, I'm not reviewing them, and they're not reviews I can do. In
theory. But really these are all reviews on my project so I should be
able to do something with them.
