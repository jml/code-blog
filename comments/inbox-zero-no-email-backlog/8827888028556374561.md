Good points JML.. I think the Inbox Zero philosophy is outdated!  
  
Expunging the Inbox is a ritual from the early days of mailbox quotas
and fear of filling up /var. There's no need to free up space these
days, and since email is instantly searchable (on Gmail at least), I
argue that it makes no sense at all to delete from your Inbox, other
than to keep your OCD at bay.  
  
It's easier these days to use Email like a "stream" - just like your
Facebook or Twitter news feed. I currently have 16,000+ messages in my
Inbox - all I care is that they are all "read". I star items that I will
come back to and that require further action.  
  
Making your Inbox Zero is a superflous action that really doesn't
achieve anything!
