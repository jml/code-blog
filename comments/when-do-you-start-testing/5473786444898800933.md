When a program gets big enough that I have to perform more than 2 manual
actions (commands, clicks, hits to an URL).  
  
If I can get \~100% coverage and instant repeatability by simply
re-running the program (script) then there's no point to an automated
test suite; the program is effectively testing itself. But, once I need
to do five, six, or seven things in order to start testing it
comprehensively, I will start forgetting some of the steps, doing some
of them wrong, or occasionally skipping them, and maintenance
difficulties set in.  
  
Pretty much any non-trivial program fits into this category, of course.
But many trivial programs of the "rename a bunch of audio files" variety
are easy to test just by having some stub input and re-running it until
the output looks right.
