Usually not at the right time.  
  
Sometimes I start too early (before I write my first line of code) and
it slows down my progress too much, causing me to get distracted before
I have a working initial version that would keep me interested.  
  
Sometimes I start too late and that means I have to do a lot of
refactoring and after-the-fact writing of tests. Often this is at a
point where I have spent more time then necessary in a debugger trying
to figure out which layer of my code is buggy.
