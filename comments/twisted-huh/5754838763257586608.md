For me the biggest issue with Twisted is the steep learning curve. It
isn't helped by the documentation - although the twisted book goes some
way to dealing with that. Most of what I know about Twisted I learned
from the source code though.  
  
I wrote a large heavy duty crawler in it - including custom DNS and HTTP
protocols. And if I was honest I am still not 100% sure how the
protocol/factory bits work although I obviously have made them work well
(because the crawler worked really well)  
  
Not sure what or even if you would want to do something about this.
Twisted is incredibly powerful and can do some superb stuff - but on the
other hand I am unlikely to start new projects with it because either I
maintain it or I have to push team members up that learning curve before
they can do anything on it.
