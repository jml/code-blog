I keep hearing things like this as well, and I just don't understand why
so many are so intimidated by twisted. It really isn't any harder to get
to grips with than any other large python project like TG IMHO. They do
have some tools to kick you into gear a little faster perhaps.  
  
I also hear things like "twisted eats your errors", "twisted doesn't let
me use threads", "twisted can't work with my libraries", "you can't use
databases with twisted" - all utter nonsense, but I keep hearing it over
and over again. They're usually in the form of anecdotal stories
"twisted ate all my errors, I promise I attached errbacks".  
  
Some 5 minute howtos may be the answer to some of these. If we listen to
a few of these complaints and create a "how to access your \${foo}sql
instance", "how to set up logging", "how to use
callInThread/callFromThread", "why forgetting your errbacks is bad" it
could be something to point folks to.
