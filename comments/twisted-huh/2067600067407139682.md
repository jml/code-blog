"B" said. Twisted's just too impenetrable for newbies. As a seasoned
Twisted programmer (ie. I've written a few systems using it) I'm still
not sure where to look in the docs for simple things like the API for
deferreds and how they work.  
  
The inheritance tree is part of this: the API docs for a lot of classes
just indicate that they inherit from some other class(es) and add some
(un- or poorly-documented) new methods. To find out how to use said
class you have to dig right down to the base class(es) and often their
documentation is also poor/missing/too abstract.
