I like Twisted.  
  
But, I know where people are coming from. You get a bunch of docs that
just don't seem to quite fit together and the API reference just doesn't
seem quite finished, so your learning process is scattered all over the
place.  
  
So you read a tutorial and you get told you have to write 10 lines of
code, except you only know what 1 of those lines actually does. The rest
is just "necessary", but since you don't know what it does, it's easy to
see why people think it's unnecessary boilerplate, when in fact it's a
bunch of powerful tools that you can use to extend your application.  
  
I really believe that the only thing that creates such an unexpected
number of Twisted detractors is the fact that there isn't a nice, easy,
pretty, consistent documentation system that takes each part of Twisted
as a clean slate, providing easy access to all the core stuff that's
being used in the examples as assumed knowledge.  
  
Once the assumed knowledge is clearly laid out and accessable from every
page I think everything will fall into place.  
  
Learning a new API, especially one as extensive as Twisted's, is hard
enough already, without also having to juggle in your mind a kludgy and
patchy documentation system.  
  
(I really, really do like Twisted a lot though)
