Kilroy, I think you need to read the comments already posted here (maybe
again, but reading your reply I can't help thinking for the first
time).  
  
In particular, about HOWTOs "B" specifically said "So you read a
tutorial and you get told you have to write 10 lines of code, except you
only know what 1 of those lines actually does."  
  
Without solid API documentation to back them up those HOWTOs are
basically just crumbs thrown out to try to satisfy the hungry masses.
