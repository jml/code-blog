I think it would be a lot easier to understand Twisted if it was
smaller. I don't mean remove features, but rather reduce cases where it
duplicates functionality from the standard library.  
  
For example, if I am trying to understand the deferred concept, I need
to understand failures. I already understand exceptions, but now need to
learn about this similar but slightly different concept.  
  
For each of the bits of twisted.python where standard library interfaces
have been extended, it would be good to consider them bugs that should
eventually be fixed by getting the standard library updated. For
failures, perhaps the exception handling changes in Python 3 are enough
to use directly.  
  
In other cases, I think it would be useful to look at pushing some of
Twisted's core concepts into the standard libraries. The deferred system
is one I've mentioned before. The API review that would come it would
likely be helpful too.
