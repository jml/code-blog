My thoughts are not as specific as other commenters, but essentially:
bzr does not provide any way to judge the level of change in its
releases: the number is essentially 1.X where X is the number of months
since 1.0 (give or take).  
  
While Ubuntu also uses a similar strategy, most Free Software people
really are accustomed to X.Y where a change in X means big changes
including likely major fixes and improvements but also to beware of
breakage, and a change in Y means tweaks to what you know, breakage
unlikely. (For projects with dependant projects, X.Y.Z is better where a
change in Z means no ABI/API break from the previous release, as
required.)  
  
Of course, one can get this from the release notes, but one doesn't read
them...
