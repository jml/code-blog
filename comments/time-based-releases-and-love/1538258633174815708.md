Please keep the monthly releases. It's quite nice to have the new
features on a packaged format earlier. The developer are forced to keep
the project in a "releasable" state more often too.  
  
But I'd ask, \*please\*, don't add new default repository formats so
often.  
My proposal: do time-based \*major\* (2.0, 3.0, ...) releases too, every
6 months for example, and add a new default format only to this
releases.  
  
The new format, accumulating all backward incompatible changes, could be
developed on a branch and integrated as a --development format when its
good enough (like it is now), but only released as the default on a
major release.  
  
This way, distributions can offer always a bzr with the latest (or
almost) format, and teams/hosting sites/sysadmins can get prepared to
upgrade their repos less often.
