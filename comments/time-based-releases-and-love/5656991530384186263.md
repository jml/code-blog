I have to agree with Eduardo there. One of the reasons specifically
cited by Brett Cannon today when discussing Python-on-hg is the number
of changes to release formats in bzr.  
  
I think that has way more of an impact on the impression of stability
than does the frequency of releases; people just want to know it will
always work wherever they happen to need some code, regardless of what
version is installed there.  
  
I don't see any reason to question the basic concept of always being
ready to release, but that's not the same as releasing all the time. :-)
Every month is good for a pre-1.0, after that, 3 or 6 months is a better
pace to set. Being ready gives you the ability to do a critical bugfix
release at the drop of a hat.
