@bialix: I think that point releases (especially when security fixes and
fixes for major regression are involved) should be released any time if
needed.  
  
If bzr is to move to a longer release cycle (3 months, say), it can
still do montly alpha/beta releases: an alpha on the end of the first
month, a beta on the end of the second one (if no release critical bug
id found, them is could slip some days), and a rc or two on the week
before the final release.
