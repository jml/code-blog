I think bzr practive to release every 4 weeks is too frequent for the
most users/admins. Once at 2 or 3 months is much better.  
  
May be only point releases, e.g. 1.13.X should be released once at
month.  
  
E.g. for version X.Y.Z  
  
Z = every month (only bugfixes)  
Y = every 3 months (improvements)  
X = every 9-12 months (big improvements, new formats)
