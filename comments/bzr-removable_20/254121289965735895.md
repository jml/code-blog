Sure, I'm not laying down a fundamental law of physics here -- I'm
describing my own personal motivation.  
  
I'm sorry that your whole experience of this plugin has been terrible,
and I'm glad you've gone to the trouble of posting here so that other
googlers can find the docs you've written.  
  
As this is obviously the first user feedback I've received, I would have
liked to hear something nice, but perhaps there was nothing nice to
say.
