Fuller and more prominent documentation would be appreciated (in general
my rule of thumb is that if I've had to go to a core developer of a
piece of software for assistance, it's not well documented!)  
  
The full sequence of install steps for this (on UNIX filesystems) is
actually:  
  
\$ cd [some directory where one normally stores code]  
\$ bzr branch lp:bzr-removable  
\$ mkdir -p \~/.bazaar/plugins  
\$ cd \~/.bazaar/plugins  
\$ ln -s [some directory]/bzr-removable/removeable  
  
Then "bzr plugins" will verify the install and finally the actual
commands one needs are "bzr removable" and "bzr unremovable"
