The mathematics definition of idempotent sort of makes sense in
computing if you view a function as taking a state and returning the
state of the system after the function is applied.  
  
Then the property f(f(x)) = f(x) seems like a desirable one if equality
is replaced by some equivalence relation  
  
This is still weaker than invariance of f though...
