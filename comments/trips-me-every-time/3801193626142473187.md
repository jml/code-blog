Michael Hudson: Oh right! I remember now.  
  
Actually, idempotency in the computing sense is only meaningful where
there ARE side effects.  
  
For a couple of pythonic examples: "a[b] = c" where a is a list IS
idempotent. But "a.pop()" is not.  
  
Since the last thing you want from a hash function is to mutate its
argument, the only meaningful sense for "idempotent hash function" is
the mathematical one.  
  
And etrepum is confused.
