Idempotency (in computing) is not the same as side-effect free, or
always returning the same value for the same arguments, but rather than
calling it multiple times has the same effect as calling it once. Bob is
perhaps using bigs words where simple ones would do :)  
  
Alex is right that this is the same as the mathematical definition if
you view the state of the world as implicitly passed to and returned
from every function you call.
