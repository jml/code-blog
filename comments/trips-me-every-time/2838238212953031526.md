Oh, a new pet peeve!  
  
From now on I'll make it a point that "idempotent" DOES mean "f(f(x)) =
f(x)".  
  
I did not realize that people were using it with this other, incorrect
meaning.  
  
f(x)=f(x) is invariant, or referentially transparent, or side-effect
free, whatever. Real idempotence is a useful property to be able to name
in computing.  
  
Join me and embrace the joy of self-righteousness!
