I've been struggling with the same trouble. Trying to learn Haskell from
long time.  
  
I've learnt Scheme in the past at a quite good pace by studying
[SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/). I think having incremental
exercises to try makes it easier to learn a new language. I haven't
found something like that for Haskell yet.
