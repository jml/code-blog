Keeping a journal, or at least a place to dump notes is something I do a
lot of. Collaborators & long-time readers of this blog have my
bullet-pointed reflections inflicted on them more than once.  
  
On G+, Gustavo recommended picking a project for which the result
matters, but not necessarily the timeliness. I think that's a really
good idea.
