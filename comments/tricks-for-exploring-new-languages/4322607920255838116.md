Perhaps don't push yourself so hard to leave the Python ecosystem
entirely; if you're comfortable there, and that's what you really want
to be doing with your spare time, don't fight it, embrace it. For
example, I have a reasonably good grasp of ObjC and a pretty wide
breadth of ObjC APIs now due to messing with PyObjC bridging. If you
want to learn Go, and no Python-Go bridge exists, make one, and I'm sure
you'll learn a ton about the Go runtime :). Then you can do some things
up to the edge of your comfort zone, and when you get to something that
Python isn't good at, you can switch over into the new thing and have a
more concrete motivation to learn it.  
  
(Or, you know, just stay in Python but dive into the deep end. I'm sure
you can gain complete understanding of all current and possible
programming languages by working on sufficiently deep internals in
PyPy...)
