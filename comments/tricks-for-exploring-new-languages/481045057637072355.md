Good question -- I have the same problem.  
  
Things that helped me in the past (eg. learning Erlang) was the
(probably) usual anti-procrastination stuff: \*) set aside some fixed
time \*) set goals eg. "I'll complete this-and-this prototype by
tomorrow", \*) tons of external pressure \*) keep a journal to reflect
on the cool stuff you've learned  
  
I'd be very interested what other people do...
