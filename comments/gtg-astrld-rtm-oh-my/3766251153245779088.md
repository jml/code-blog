It sounds like GTG ballsed something up. Whatever it was that made you
delete all of your work should probably be reported as a a bug :).  
  
I am reminded of [Havoc Pennington's screed on the
subject](http://ometer.com/free-software-ui.html). Get them to fix
whatever in the UI did not put a GIANT molly-guard over this feature :).
