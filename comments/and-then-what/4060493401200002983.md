Hey Jelmer,  
  
I fully agree. If Launchpad ever provided support for other VCS clients,
it would have to be in such a way that you could still use Bazaar
regardless of the project.  
  
Supporting VCS-specific protocols on top of Bazaar repos seems like the
ideal way of doing that. But you would certainly know better than I :)
