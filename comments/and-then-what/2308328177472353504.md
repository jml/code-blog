Sense, it'll be a long time before the Canonical team works on proper
Semantic stuff for Launchpad, but we'd be open to contributions. If
you're interested, you might want to talk to the FusionForge guys about
it.  
  
*If* we do the issue tracker work, we'll definitely consider those
cases. Some folk want to merge Answers in too. There are a lot of traps
here, so we're going to have to be careful.  
  
Better project roles is a longstanding issue and I agree it should be
fixed. Thanks for the reminder.  
  
We've been thinking a little bit recently about how to group projects
together better on Launchpad, but I don't think we had put Ubuntu into
the mix. (I'm reminded of [mdz's product, platform, project
post](http://mdzlog.alcor.net/2010/11/15/ubuntu-project-platform-products/)).  
  
Alex, glad you like it :)
