Am I dreaming? I agree 100% with the other comments with respect to vcs
support. Bzr is pretty fast on top of git and svn already. Maybe a
git-bzr bridge for users of git to talk to bzr repos, but keeping
launchpad standardized on bzr is a good choice.  
  
The dashboard and issue tracker things sound like a dream come true.
Please steal me from DX to work on this ;)
