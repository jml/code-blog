To me, Launchpad provides a structured view of the very diverse free
software world, with a flat namespace. No matter what the upstream
project uses Launchpad can provide me the source code, the bugs, the
Ubuntu packages and the translations for that project and allow me to
use the same tools I use for all other projects too. This is a unique
thing about Launchpad, it's what makes it so great for people who hack
on multiple projects (like packagers).  
  
Support for other version control systems seems like a great thing to
support. I'm biased here, but rather than allowing plain hosting of
every possible DVCS as e.g. SourceForge provides it would be nice if
Launchpad could maintain its tight integration. Perhaps I'm biased here,
but I'd like to see Launchpad e.g. support Subversion's mod\_dav
protocol on top of Bazaar repositories, much like GitHub does on top of
Git repositories (https://github.com/blog/626-announcing-svn-support).  
  
Having a proper dashboard would be a really great addition I think.
