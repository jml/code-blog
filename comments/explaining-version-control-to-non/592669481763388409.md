I ask them if they have ever edited Wikipedia, and if they have, I point
out version control features in Wikipedia to them, and how they help
people to collaborate.  
  
For programmers that are new to version control, I point them to
http://www.ericsink.com/scm/source\_control.html which is and excellent
and comprehensive guide to version control. It is pre-dvcs, so it could
do with an update.
