Hi jml,  
  
I've never used Layers, but these points seem right. One thing that I
find missing from this post is a discussion of some of the alternatives.
For example, I know I am sometimes tempted to add new methods to
TestCase and require the runner to find them. It's not always obvious
how to add features without expanding the interface. When I started
writing this post, I had an example of this, but then it slipped away
from me. Oops.
