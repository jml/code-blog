Be a perfectionist when testing/reporting usability problems and a
pragmatist when planning your work and scheduling your releases. The
trap of perfectionism is really a trap of poor planning. If you allow
yourself to tinker with whatever has your attention at the moment,
you'll never reach a stable place. Raising your standards means never
being completely happy with a release.
