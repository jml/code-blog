I'm not a fan of doctest.OutputChecker either. I don't find spelling
assertions with ellipses rather than regular expressions much of an
improvement, and the mismatch output nearly always confuses me. There
must be some better pattern for doing checks on (potentially very) large
text blocks that's easy to write and actually produces good errors. I've
not managed to come up with one though...
