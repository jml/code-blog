Why not just have it blacklist specific commands. For example
"vi/emacs/less". I don't know specifically how you are looking at text
for a long time, but it seems the commands that run are going to be
fairly different.  
  
There are also easy things if you know a command is going to be slow,
like setting up a shell command to run a sound file/pop up a
notification, and alias it to something short like 'n' and then just  
  
command; n  
  
It isn't quite as auto-magical, but it does avoid false positives.
