@Steve Terminator has plugins that do that. However, what I wanted was
something that I didn't have to enable or disable at all, and something
that wouldn't do false positives even if the command spewed stuff all
the time.  
  
@Tuure Good point. My hunch is that problem is best solved at the
notify-send level.
