Hmm. I'm a loooong time konsole fan, and that functionality is built in.
"View; Monitor for Silence" or "Monitor for Activity".  
Use it quite a lot for long running commands/rollouts etc.  
Used to be better in previous versions, that you could adjust the time
before alert; but alas, that's been removed.  
  
I have my layout setup such that the konsole tab bar (at the bottom
where it belongs) is \*always\* visible, so when something changes, it
flashes, I see it instantly.
