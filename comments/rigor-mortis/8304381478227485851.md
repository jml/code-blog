I find that, when confronted with a muddled mess of ideas in email,
friendly, direct communication is best. Especially because people will
almost always surprise you with their capacity to improve their
communications, and you'll rarely have to write a "these are the
twenty-seven logical fallacies that you have committed in this message"
kind of message twice.  
  
It can take some practice to make this kind of communique not come off
as super condescending, but it's definitely doable. The trick is to keep
the focus on the communication and not the person or the ideas.
