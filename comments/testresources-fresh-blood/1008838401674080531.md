Thanks for the comments John.  
  
1) The way to run the testresources tests is 'make check'. I guess
test\_all can be tweaked to do PYTHONPATH setup.  
  
2) The dependency is on zope.interfaces -- available separately from the
main zope. I guess I don't really need to use it, and could use an
abstract class instead.
