I thought I'd give a look at the testresources code. I've peeked at it
before, and I'm generally interested in both testresources and your
pyunit3k work.  
  
Some quick comments:  
  
1) There is a 'test\_all.py' file in the root directory, but running it
fails because the actual library is under 'lib/'. So you have to do
something like "PYTHONPATH='lib' ./test\_all.py" which seems a bit odd.  
  
2) In grabbing pyunit3k, I figured I'd run \*its\* test suite as well.
However that seems to depend on 'Zope' being installed. Which is a
rather huge dependency for a small library. Is it truly dependent? Is it
only the test suite? Could you something like the bzr 'Feature' work to
make it a soft-dependency? (Test if it is available, else skip and warn)
