I've seen a set of blog regulars do this voluntarily. It ended up being
kind of amusing for a while, except for the one who took advantage of it
to attack another regular. They ended up needing to drop masks early.  
  
Same blog has an occasional convention of formal psuedonym-change to
confess more uncomfortable secrets, but one confessed to being a rapist,
that was a little awkward too.  
  
So yeah, I do wonder how often it would be used to be either
unpleasantly mean or unpleasantly revealing.
