Blog ideas
##########

One section for each idea for a blog post in my backlog.

Each section has:

 * short summary
 * intended audience
 * what I hope the audience will get out of it
 * effort estimate from 1 (easy) to 5 (major project)


Parallel ``for`` loops in Rust
------------------------------

Take well-known parallel ``for`` loop patterns from Go and translate them into
Rust.

Audience: Go programmers who are curious about Rust, Rust programmers who want
to feel smug.

Effort: 4 (I've already tried doing this and found it too hard. Turns out I've
forgotten Rust.)

Outcome:
 * Go programmers feel tempted to use / explore Rust more
 * Rust programmers learn about parallelism
 * I learn about Rust

Parallel ``for`` loops in Haskell
---------------------------------

Take well-known parallel ``for`` loop patterns from Go and translate them into
Haskell.

Unlike Rust post, this would not be focusing on the merits of Haskell quite as
much, but instead using it as a vehicle for thinking about patterns in a
structured way.

Audience: ???

Effort: 3

Outcome:
 * Go programmers feel tempted to use / explore Haskell more
 * Haskell programmers learn more about parallelism
 * Haskell programmers better equipped to contend with Haskell

haskell-cli-template
--------------------

Finish up my work on the Haskell CLI template that I've made and announce it.

Audience: Haskell developers

Effort: 2

Outcome:
 * Haskell developers are better equipped to use Haskell in contexts where
   they might have previously reached for Python / Go
