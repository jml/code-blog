I keep telling people I want a "fetch mail" button in my mail client,
and they look at me like I've grown an extra head.

I want to try to articulate what I mean.

Let's start with a story.

I was helping write the `post-mortem`_ for a highly technical incident which had serious business impact.
My current task was to write up the full timeline of the incident.
To do this, I needed to figure out exactly when it was that we first received a hint that we might have a problem.
Naturally, I opened my email client (`Inbox`_) to search for the relevant terms.
When I open my client, I see an email from my CEO.
He's disappointed (with me?) about how little effort we've been putting in to a certain open source project,
and is worried that our core product work is diverging from this.
He thinks a blog post would help.
At this point, I'm worried.
Why is the CEO emailing me about this? Why not my boss (his direct report)?
What even is this open source project, and why didn't he tell us it was important before?
What's the blog post even supposed to be about, and is he asking me to do it?
How angry is he about this really?
How am I going to reply to this in a way that moves this forward without throwing anyone under the bus?

All this takes about ten seconds, and all thought of the post-mortem has evaporated from my mind.

Which sucks, because I still need to finish 

I use email a lot.
Perhaps the primary way I use it as a system of record.
Google Inbox and Gmail can be easily searched, and store my communications forever,
so I use them as an archive of all my correspondence.
I frequently go into my email to answer questions like "What is this person's phone number?" or "What exactly did this customer ask for?" or "When did we become aware of this problem?".

When I'm not using email as a reference system, I'm using it to write to people,
generally to ask them to do something or to tell them about some change.
Email is great for these because it's naturally grouped by topic,
so when you ask someone for something, they can reply to your email saying they've done it, and you automatically have the request to hand.
This is invaluable if you've got a lot on your plate.
Writing requests or announcements generally takes me a bit of time,
because I want to write something that actually gets read and doesn't send the wrong message.

Neither of these use cases involve 

Currently in my personal inbox:

 - reply to a PR review which mostly but not quite deals with the points I raised -- I need to respond carefully to identify whether the disparity is due to confusion or genuine disagreement
 - a note from a clothing retailer telling me a thing I want is in stock again -- I need to go online to buy the item, after registering with their website
 - a letter from my storage company telling me they are bumping the prices -- I need to investigate switching to a different provider
 - a friend giving me bank account details so I can reimburse her for a holiday rental we're getting together -- I need to figure out how much to pay, which means reading through the entire thread and making a socially complicated judgement call, and then log in to my bank to make the transfer
 - a thread that's leftover from yesterday that I need to send a nice 'thank you' note on

And in my work inbox:

 - a report asking to work from a different location for 2-4 weeks, which causes some scheduling problems for me
 - a request for review for a config-changing PR
 - a request for review for a spec for a new feature
 - someone asking for permission to access a certain repository
 - a thread CCd from my CEO asking a contractor whether he's making progress on a thing related to a project I'm involved in
 - someone suggesting we use Terraform to manage Standuply (we can't, and they aren't being 100% serious about it)
 - my COO asking for a decision about pursuing a certain consulting engagement
 - my CEO asking for review of a strategic blog post
 - a new employee giving an unclear reply to me chasing them up about their onboarding tasks

These span a pretty broad spectrum. Lots of them have emotional or social
weight. I can deal with emotionally and socially difficult things, but it
takes time and energy, and often ruins me for anything else for a little
while. Thank heaven that none of these are particularly vexing.

More fundamentally, I don't get any control over what appears in my inbox.



I didn't open my email to get all these problems.
