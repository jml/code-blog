                <p>By now, you know where Launchpad is at. You know what <a href="http://code.mumak.net/2010/11/what-to-do-what-to-do.html">our top
priorities</a>
are, you know the <a href="http://code.mumak.net/2010/11/still-going.html">other important stuff that we're still working
on</a>, you know <a href="http://code.mumak.net/2010/11/what-else-have-you-got.html">the other
bits and pieces we've got
going</a>. You
might even know why.  </p>
<p>What you might not know, and what this post hopes to tell you, is what
we are <em>thinking</em> about right now. Humans are plan-making creatures, and
product strategists perhaps more so than most. What follows is a brief
description of the half-formed thoughts and plans that I have for
Launchpad. (Also, have I mentioned the
<a href="http://dev.launchpad.net/RoadMap">roadmap</a> yet?)  </p>
<p>Strategically speaking, there are two major approaches we can take to
our work on Launchpad. The first is working on things that bring new
users and new projects to us. This would mean finding something that we
can provide that alternatives don't and potential users want, <em>or</em>
assuming that we already have such a thing, find the blockers that stop
people from using Launchpad and remove them (the blockers, not the
people).  </p>
<p>For example, if we thought that open source developers wanted their
hosting site, say, to be part of the semantic web, we could go and do
that and be relatively confident that no one else will. That would be
finding a competitive advantage.  </p>
<p>Or, to take another example, we could say that our awesome bug tracker,
our translation support and daily builds are heaps plenty good
advantages, but people don't use Launchpad because we only have full
support for one VCS and we provide no place to host a project shop-front
web site. That would mean adding Git, Subversion and Mercurial support,
and adding some kind of wiki / webhosting. Personally, I find this much
more appealing than semantic web shenanigans.  </p>
<p>All of that's one strategic approach: attract new users. There's another
major approach that we could take: make things better for our current
users. All things considered, I think I want to take the second
approach.  </p>
<p>There's so much we could do here, partly because Launchpad itself is so
broad. Some key things stand out though.  </p>
<p>First, there is a cluster of problems related to the way that people
approach the website. Although we tout cross-project collaboration as
one of our big things, we don't make it particularly easy. We need to
provide each user and each team with a view that shows them all of the
things that are interesting to them across all of Launchpad. In fact, we
probably need to give them two views: one that's historical and
chronological, and another that's forward looking and more
dashboard-like. In my head, I've been thinking of this as <strong>walls</strong> (ala
Facebook) and <strong>dashboards</strong>.  </p>
<p>If we dig into this, there'll be other changes: better, fairer karma;
more social interaction; better person, project and team pages; a
"waiting for" section in the dashboard so you can see who to hassle; a
better experience for new users; and probably death to the home page for
users who've got accounts. Lots of goodness here.  </p>
<p>Second, it's becoming increasingly clear that blueprints are a good idea
with a sub-standard implementation. Persuaded largely by Matthew Paul
Thomas, I think that we should merge the blueprint tracker with the bug
tracker to make a <strong><a href="http://dev.launchpad.net/IssueTracker">combined issue
tracker</a></strong>. A lot of people get
worried when I say this, because they really like blueprints and they
understand that bugs and blueprints are actually two different things.
Please don't worry. There will almost certainly always be something in
Launchpad like a blueprint or specification that is visibly different
from a bug. However, I think we ought to change what lists they appear
in, what statuses they have and many other things. The loss of
distinctiveness will be more than made up for with an increase in
capability.  </p>
<p>Third, the way we <strong>search</strong> and the way we display results of searches
needs to be revamped to be faster and more flexible. I want to see easy
forms, a good search string mini-language, sexy URLs, searches that can
be saved and shared.  </p>
<p>There's so much more that we could do, that we ought to do: make mailing
lists rock; inline commenting on merge proposals; eliminate all of the
silly "refresh this page" business that we still have; go to series and
milestones with a sharp axe and a clear conscience; provide top-notch
tools for QA teams; show way more cool stuff based on our data; make
filing bugs upstream a complete no-brainer; clean up the terminology we
use for naming things; provide an event sending interface for
launchpadlib so that people don't have to poll. I could go on for a very
long time.  </p>
<p>I call out the three things above – cross-project views, merging bugs
and blueprints and better search – because I think they are things that
will make Launchpad better for absolutely everyone who uses it. In
particular, done right, good cross-project views turns a weakness into a
strength. It takes the vast, daunting size of Launchpad and instead
turns it into a huge realm of opportunity.  </p>
<p>Now, none of this is fixed in concrete. There's still plenty of time to
discuss, plan out, change our minds and what not. But it's what's in my
head right now.  </p>
<p>That's it. Right now, we're working on <strong>privacy</strong>, <strong>performance</strong>,
<strong>derived archives</strong> and <strong>desktop integration</strong> as our top priorities.
We're still plugging away at <strong>daily builds</strong> and <strong>making links</strong>
between distributions and upstreams, and we're working on a host of
useful, important things. In the future, if my plans go as … planned,
then we'll have <strong>dashboards</strong>, activity <strong>walls</strong>, a <strong>combined issue
tracker</strong> and excellent <strong>search</strong>.  </p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

                <p>To me, Launchpad provides a structured view of the very diverse free
software world, with a flat namespace. No matter what the upstream
project uses Launchpad can provide me the source code, the bugs, the
Ubuntu packages and the translations for that project and allow me to
use the same tools I use for all other projects too. This is a unique
thing about Launchpad, it's what makes it so great for people who hack
on multiple projects (like packagers).  </p>
<p>Support for other version control systems seems like a great thing to
support. I'm biased here, but rather than allowing plain hosting of
every possible DVCS as e.g. SourceForge provides it would be nice if
Launchpad could maintain its tight integration. Perhaps I'm biased here,
but I'd like to see Launchpad e.g. support Subversion's mod_dav
protocol on top of Bazaar repositories, much like GitHub does on top of
Git repositories (https://github.com/blog/626-announcing-svn-support).  </p>
<p>Having a proper dashboard would be a really great addition I think.</p>

                <p>Hey Jelmer,  </p>
<p>I fully agree. If Launchpad ever provided support for other VCS clients,
it would have to be in such a way that you could still use Bazaar
regardless of the project.  </p>
<p>Supporting VCS-specific protocols on top of Bazaar repos seems like the
ideal way of doing that. But you would certainly know better than I :)  </p>

                <p>Posted on <abbr class="published" title="2010-11-16T16:15:00">Tue 16 November 2010</abbr></p>
                
                <p>The first thing I think after reading this post is: great work,
Launchpad Team! You've been doing an awesome job and if you look at
where Launchpad came from, so much has been improved.  </p>
<p>I have to admit that I am a bit of a semantic web fan, and I would love
to see more semantics coming to Launchpad, but I understand there are
more important things.  </p>
<p>The things you mention in your post look great, and I agree with your
plans to (somewhat) merge Blueprints and Bugs. Changing the name of the
bug tracker to Issue Tracker would already be an improvement, because it
would be more inclusive and describe better the possible uses of the
tracker.  </p>
<p>Because bug tracking is being used for more things than just plain
software bugs. There is a Launchpad project that contains bug reports
concerning community issues. Many LoCos, including mine, use Launchpad
to manage tasks in the bug tracker. The most notable example, though,
would be the One Hundred Paper Cuts project. It is used for reporting
bugs that are in fact mostly usability issues. They require a bit more
discussion and are not (always) exactly bugs. (More information about
what constitutes a paper cut can be found at .)<br />
It would be great if these other uses of the bug/issue tracker would be
considered during the design of the (partial?) merge of the blueprint
and bug trackers.  </p>
<p>Another issue we see is the fact that the Ubuntu community and Canonical
created several different projects on Launchpad to manage subprojects of
the Ubuntu project. It is not possible to make a link between the
'ubuntu' distribution type project on Launchpad and its subprojects,
like 'ubuntu-community', 'hundredpapercuts' and others. This has the
consequence that the 'ubuntu' project on Launchpad only contains bugs
and source and translations of the packages in the main repositories.
But there is more to the project! It would be great if Launchpad could
make the other aspects of the community more visible by allowing to link
projects together.  </p>
<p>I think that something else that would increase clarity and make the
project pages on Launchpad more useful would be displaying roles on the
front and section pages. Currently Launchpad already has some roles
displayed (Driver, Maintainer, Bug Supervisor and such), but these are
limited and do not cover the full community. Instead, or in addition to
this, Launchpad could allow projects to create roles/functions (with a
unique (per-project) slug for API authentication purposes) and assign
teams or persons to it. This would give visitors (and, if the proper
semantics would be used, also bots ;)) a way to find out who is
responsible for what and contact them and. be an authoritative source
for this kind of information.  </p>
<p>Also, if you would do away with the set roles that give permissions,
like Driver or Maintainer, you could create a much more flexible
permission system by allowing project maintainers to assign capabilities
to roles. Instead of the Bug Supervisor being shown at the bug tracker
page, you would see the roles that have bug-related capabilities there.
This would allow every project to complete customise its permissions.  </p>
<p>Especially now Launchpad is used more and more as a provider for
authentication and permissions such a system would increase Launchpad's
value as a platform to offer this information.  </p>
<p>These are some ideas that came up in me/I remembered. I hope you like
them, or at least that they help you with getting (even more!) ideas for
Launchpad's future.</p>

                <p>Am I dreaming? I agree 100% with the other comments with respect to vcs
support. Bzr is pretty fast on top of git and svn already. Maybe a
git-bzr bridge for users of git to talk to bzr repos, but keeping
launchpad standardized on bzr is a good choice.  </p>
<p>The dashboard and issue tracker things sound like a dream come true.
Please steal me from DX to work on this ;)</p>

                <p>Sense, it'll be a long time before the Canonical team works on proper
Semantic stuff for Launchpad, but we'd be open to contributions. If
you're interested, you might want to talk to the FusionForge guys about
it.  </p>
<p><em>If</em> we do the issue tracker work, we'll definitely consider those
cases. Some folk want to merge Answers in too. There are a lot of traps
here, so we're going to have to be careful.  </p>
<p>Better project roles is a longstanding issue and I agree it should be
fixed. Thanks for the reminder.  </p>
<p>We've been thinking a little bit recently about how to group projects
together better on Launchpad, but I don't think we had put Ubuntu into
the mix. (I'm reminded of <a href="http://mdzlog.alcor.net/2010/11/15/ubuntu-project-platform-products/">mdz's product, platform, project
post</a>).  </p>
