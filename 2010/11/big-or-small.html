                <p>I've been thinking a bit about whether it is better to have one big code
base that has a lot of different components and features, or whether
there should be many small code bases that each do one thing well.  </p>
<p>I don't have any answers, but perhaps these half-formed thoughts will
help: positive, negative and interesting things about having many small
related projects. These thoughts are mostly inspired by working on a
bunch of different testing-related projects.  </p>
<p><strong>Positive</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>
"Do one thing and do it well"

</li>
<li>
Enforces a certain kind of interface discipline

</li>
<li>
Avoids/postpones scaling problems with big projects

</li>
-   test suite run times
-   documentation navigation
-   bug triage
-   forking mailing lists etc.

<li>
Newcomers only need to "buy in" to one idea at a time

</li>
<li>
Aligns with conceptual understanding of the problem

</li>
<li>
Better separation of commit privs etc

</li>
</ul>

<div>

**Negative**

</div>

<div>

<ul>
<li>
Release overhead
</li>
<li>
Duplication of infrastructure
</li>
-   buildbot / hudson / pqm
-   bug tracker
-   mailing list

<li>
Duplication of license / copyright games
</li>
<li>
Harder for newcomers to see the big picture
</li>
<li>
Problems caused by interactions between different versions
</li>
<li>
Depending on multiple libraries is a pain on many platforms
</li>
<li>
Lag with commit privs etc
</li>
</ul>
<div>

**Interesting**

</div>

</div>

<div>

-   Perhaps smaller & self-contained means easier to upstream
-   Some projects like adding only small dependencies, other projects
    like adding few dependencies

<div>

Do these make sense? What would you add?

</div>

</div>

<div>

Twisted is in a sense the opposite of the small/many paradigm, in that
it includes a great deal of extra features along with its core.

                <p>Perhaps a related question is how easy is to take a many small code
bases and bundle them as one later, versus separating one big code base
into many small ones? I think small has a slight advantage over big
here: in general the pain I've observed in e.g. building bzr's windows
installer or various core+plugins PPAs has probably been a little less
than Twisted's pain in producing releases of individual subpackages. But
I'm not sure, and perhaps the tradeoffs vary quite a lot between
projects.  </p>
<p>I'm frankly deeply frightened by “scaling problems with big projects”
though. To focus on just one aspect of that, I'm increasingly feeling
that increased complexity brings massive, perhaps exponential, increase
in cost. Just compare how easy it is to do a quick hack <em>and feel that
it is good enough</em> in a small project versus a large one. For a mini
case study, look at ControlDir.sprout in current bzrlib: over time we've
added features like separate metadirs, shared repositories, stacking
policies, hardlinking, reusing transport objects, subtrees,
optimisations to the way we do a fetch into a newly sprouted
repository... and each of those things has taken a toll on this one
function. All nice things to have, but now it alarmingly difficult to
make further improvements to this function because complexity is fragile
— happily I mostly trust the test suite here, which helps, but only the
full test suite. And of course I *do* want to improve that
function...  </p>
<p>In the case of ControlDir.sprout I'm hopeful that some refactorings may
ease the pain a little, but I think truly radical surgery is required if
it is going to be anything other than hideous.  </p>
<p>So I guess I'd lean towards many small over one big, but try to find
ways to reduce the duplication release effort and project
infrastructure.</p>

                <h4>glyph (noreply@blogger.com)</h4>
                <p>Posted on <abbr class="published" title="2010-11-30T21:52:00">Tue 30 November 2010</abbr></p>
                
                <p>I don't think that you can actually model the distinction between
different types of projects as "small" vs. "big". Granted, it's a
popular dichotomy, but that doesn't mean it's not a false one :).  </p>
<p>For example: for many projects, "smaller" is better. But Twisted's
attempt to go from "big" to "small", as spiv notes, was a disaster
(although not an unqualified one). The further we pushed it, the more
duplication of process was created. If we had continued to really break
out all the subprojects fully, I suspect that most of them would be
completely moribund now. For example: if a change to core which broke
conch didn't alert us immediately to that fact, it would be <em>years</em>
before anybody got around to fixing it, probably past the point where
all hope would be lost that it was fixable at all. Does this really have
anything to do with big vs. small? Not really, it's more a question of
shared vs. duplicated build infrastructure.  </p>
<p>Another way to look at this problem is: projects aren't small or big,
it's that they fit into some conceptual model and possibly also provide
one themselves. The real question of how to organize things is more
about what those relationships are than about the absolute size of the
project.  </p>
<p>For example: "small tools that do one thing well" is frequently extolled
as a key part of the UNIX philosophy. Yet, many of those "small" tools
have intimate dependencies on a gigantic pile of infrastructure that the
<em>huge</em> lower-level projects, such as the kernel, X.org, glibc, et. al.
provide.  </p>
<p>The best projects are the ones which provide a firm core and strong
conventions upon which may be built a wide variety of tools which follow
those conventions, and be seamlessly integrated according to them. This
is what Twisted aims to be; its 'bigness' is mostly a result of the fact
that 'smallness' requires a per-project duplication of effort which,
with a small development team, we have empirically demonstrated we can't
afford.</p>

                <p>Good answers both! I'm sorry I haven't responded earlier.  </p>
<p>Glyph, I wonder how things would be different if the cost of duplicating
infrastructure was substantially lower.</p>
