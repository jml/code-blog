                <p>Software is best built incrementally. I hope everyone agrees with that.
There's quite a bit of disagreement as to what "incrementally", of
course, but it seems to have something to do with <em>iterations</em>.  </p>
<p>No one really agrees on what an iteration is either. There are a lot of
fancy metaphors and abstract phrases that get used to describe the
various bits of what people think an iteration is: customers tell
"stories" that engineers then "estimate"; programmers "sprint" like
children at an athletics carnival; they "release" software as if it were
an insufficiently randy panda; deliverables get delivered.  </p>
<p>When one washes all of the metaphors and best little practices away,
what's left is this: build a little bit of software; evaluate it.
Ideally, the software is evaluated by someone who stands to benefit
directly from using it.  </p>
<p>I'm not sure there's much more to recent software methodologies than
that. Perhaps we can explore it more in the comments.  </p>
<p>This combination of increments and iterations spirals toward the final
product, which is generally what you have left when the money runs out.
Alas, if only we could draw a picture of the process with a simple
spiral! When I think of it, I fall prey to a rare attack of envy toward
students of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics">hermeneutics</a>.  </p>
<p>The process involves spirals within spirals, cycles made up of cycles.
Going<br />
inwards from the greatest wheel to the smallest, the Launchpad project
has:  </p>
<dl>
<dt>planning cycles</dt>
<dd>When we plan the major features and general direction of Launchpad.
<a href="https://dev.launchpad.net/RoadMap">Road map</a> sort of  </dd>
<dt>stuff. Approximately six months.</dt>
<dt>feature cycles</dt>
<dd>The repeated process of beginning a feature, developing it,
releasing it,  </dd>
<dt>fixing it, then stopping. Varies in cycle time, but usually one to</dt>
<dt>three</dt>
<dt>months.</dt>
<dt>release cycles</dt>
<dd>We release whatever is in <a href="https://dev.launchpad.net/Trunk">trunk</a>
each month</dd>
<dt>branch cycles</dt>
<dd>Branch from trunk, hack on it, push it up, get it reviewed, land it,
wait  </dd>
<dt>until it passes the test suite, check that the changes worked. Two</dt>
<dt>or three</dt>
<dt>days.</dt>
<dt>experiment cycles</dt>
<dd>A developer is working on a thing and wants to actually see how it
works  </dd>
<dt>in the running code. They write many tests and a fair bit of code</dt>
<dt>and then</dt>
<dt>fire up a development instance of Launchpad and see how it looks.</dt>
<dt>TDD cycles</dt>
<dd>Write a failing test. Run the tests (a subset of the whole suite).
Make  </dd>
</dl>
<p>the test pass. Run the tests. Refactor. Run the tests. Probably
    about<br />
   half-an-hour?</p>
<p>Different projects surely have different kinds of cycles. Most projects
probably have a subset of the ones above. In any case, thinking in terms
of nested cycles is a good way of analyzing ones development process.  </p>
<p>Each of these cycles has its own overhead and its own waste. One cycle
being particularly slow has a different effect to another cycle being
slow. For example, I contend that the slow branch cycle makes it less
likely that trivial bugs get fixed.  </p>
<p>Lean advocates would tell me not to think this way. They would have me
unroll these cycles and lay them out on a line beginning with someone
wanting something and ending with that want satisfied. They would have
me draw a "value stream map".  </p>
<p>Bollocks to them. At least on Launchpad, we should optimize the
innermost loops first.  </p>
<p>Have I missed some kinds of cycles? Can you think of a better name than
"experiment cycle"? Is there prior literature I should read? Are you
going to apply these ideas to your project?</p>

                <p>We pretty much have the same set of cycles on the Landscape project,
with some having similar timelines. For example our planning cycle is 6
months, similar to Launchpad. I think our TDD cycle has a much faster
turn-around time than 30 minutes. It's more like 1 or 2, which is slower
than I'd like.  </p>
<p>Something I've been thinking about recently is a 2-3 year roadmap, a set
of high-level themes for the project that we use to guide our choices
when we make decisions regarding our planning cycle. My first thought
was that this was an outer ring that you didn't include in your post,
but I don't think that's quite right. It's more like the set of forces
that affect the direction in which the wheel is rolling.  </p>
<p>Also, I've been meaning to write this blog post for more than two years,
but have procrastinated and done nothing about this desire. Thanks for
beating me to it and describing the pieces so clearly.</p>

                <p>Robert Collins tried to comment on this post, but ran into technical
difficulties. He emailed me his comment, which I'm pasting here:  </p>
<p>I don't think Lean advocates would unroll everything - I wouldn't, and I
think I'm a Lean advocate. I'd treat the users request stalling at the
outside edge of each cycle, before it passes into an inner cycle,<br />
as a stall, and I'd try to break each cycle into little boxes so that I
could talk sensibly about how much time e.g. running tests. I naively
expect to see a similar conclusion if modelled this way - inner loops
that don't work well consume most of the duration of the vsm.</p>

                <p>Robert, I agree that taking an "optimize the inner loop" approach would
probably yield similar results to a value-stream-driven "optimize the
time between request and fulfilment".  </p>
<p>However, I'm not entirely sure it's guaranteed, and the Poppendieck's
repeatedly advocate "seeing the whole" and optimizing for it, and
frequently warn against micro-optimizing.  </p>
<p>By dividing things up into loops and cycles, I am explicitly ignoring
their advice. I can imagine that, actually, they'd approve of me doing
so.</p>

                <p>Dean, I'll do what I can. The short answer is that I think there's a lot
of waste happening at a much finer level of granularity than we track
with our Kanban board.  </p>
<p>Perhaps I can convince Francis (our local Kanban advocate) to say
something.</p>
