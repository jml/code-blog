                <p>One of the hallway conversations I've had a few times so far at
EuroPython goes like this:  </p>
<p>A: Twisted's got some good stuff going for it, but I don't like the way
it forces me to use Zope interfaces. It's too heavyweight?<br />
B: Huh? What do you mean? It doesn't make you do that.<br />
C: Yeah, there's lots of deep inheritance, which just feels really
wrong.<br />
A: Right, I have to write too much code to get something simple
working.<br />
B: Sorry, I have no idea what you mean. Can you give a concrete
example?<br />
A, C: I can't think of one right now.  </p>
<p>To me, this is a very intriguing beginning to a real conversation. Do
you know what A and C might mean here? I'd love to understand their
points so that I can form an opinion.</p>

                <p>I like Twisted.  </p>
<p>But, I know where people are coming from. You get a bunch of docs that
just don't seem to quite fit together and the API reference just doesn't
seem quite finished, so your learning process is scattered all over the
place.  </p>
<p>So you read a tutorial and you get told you have to write 10 lines of
code, except you only know what 1 of those lines actually does. The rest
is just "necessary", but since you don't know what it does, it's easy to
see why people think it's unnecessary boilerplate, when in fact it's a
bunch of powerful tools that you can use to extend your application.  </p>
<p>I really believe that the only thing that creates such an unexpected
number of Twisted detractors is the fact that there isn't a nice, easy,
pretty, consistent documentation system that takes each part of Twisted
as a clean slate, providing easy access to all the core stuff that's
being used in the examples as assumed knowledge.  </p>
<p>Once the assumed knowledge is clearly laid out and accessable from every
page I think everything will fall into place.  </p>
<p>Learning a new API, especially one as extensive as Twisted's, is hard
enough already, without also having to juggle in your mind a kludgy and
patchy documentation system.  </p>
<p>(I really, really do like Twisted a lot though)</p>

                <p>"B" said. Twisted's just too impenetrable for newbies. As a seasoned
Twisted programmer (ie. I've written a few systems using it) I'm still
not sure where to look in the docs for simple things like the API for
deferreds and how they work.  </p>
<p>The inheritance tree is part of this: the API docs for a lot of classes
just indicate that they inherit from some other class(es) and add some
(un- or poorly-documented) new methods. To find out how to use said
class you have to dig right down to the base class(es) and often their
documentation is also poor/missing/too abstract.</p>

                <p>I think it would be a lot easier to understand Twisted if it was
smaller. I don't mean remove features, but rather reduce cases where it
duplicates functionality from the standard library.  </p>
<p>For example, if I am trying to understand the deferred concept, I need
to understand failures. I already understand exceptions, but now need to
learn about this similar but slightly different concept.  </p>
<p>For each of the bits of twisted.python where standard library interfaces
have been extended, it would be good to consider them bugs that should
eventually be fixed by getting the standard library updated. For
failures, perhaps the exception handling changes in Python 3 are enough
to use directly.  </p>
<p>In other cases, I think it would be useful to look at pushing some of
Twisted's core concepts into the standard libraries. The deferred system
is one I've mentioned before. The API review that would come it would
likely be helpful too.</p>

                <p>For me the biggest issue with Twisted is the steep learning curve. It
isn't helped by the documentation - although the twisted book goes some
way to dealing with that. Most of what I know about Twisted I learned
from the source code though.  </p>
<p>I wrote a large heavy duty crawler in it - including custom DNS and HTTP
protocols. And if I was honest I am still not 100% sure how the
protocol/factory bits work although I obviously have made them work well
(because the crawler worked really well)  </p>
<p>Not sure what or even if you would want to do something about this.
Twisted is incredibly powerful and can do some superb stuff - but on the
other hand I am unlikely to start new projects with it because either I
maintain it or I have to push team members up that learning curve before
they can do anything on it.</p>

                <p>I keep hearing things like this as well, and I just don't understand why
so many are so intimidated by twisted. It really isn't any harder to get
to grips with than any other large python project like TG IMHO. They do
have some tools to kick you into gear a little faster perhaps.  </p>
<p>I also hear things like "twisted eats your errors", "twisted doesn't let
me use threads", "twisted can't work with my libraries", "you can't use
databases with twisted" - all utter nonsense, but I keep hearing it over
and over again. They're usually in the form of anecdotal stories
"twisted ate all my errors, I promise I attached errbacks".  </p>
<p>Some 5 minute howtos may be the answer to some of these. If we listen to
a few of these complaints and create a "how to access your \${foo}sql
instance", "how to set up logging", "how to use
callInThread/callFromThread", "why forgetting your errbacks is bad" it
could be something to point folks to.</p>

                <p>Kilroy, I think you need to read the comments already posted here (maybe
again, but reading your reply I can't help thinking for the first
time).  </p>
<p>In particular, about HOWTOs "B" specifically said "So you read a
tutorial and you get told you have to write 10 lines of code, except you
only know what 1 of those lines actually does."  </p>
<p>Without solid API documentation to back them up those HOWTOs are
basically just crumbs thrown out to try to satisfy the hungry masses.</p>
