                <p>I like unit testing a lot. I've recently been thinking about whether it
really is everything that advocates like myself make it out to be. I'm
still thinking, but I reckon that language has something to do with it,
and that I wouldn't like TDD so much if I were writing in Haskell.
Maybe.</p>
<div>

Anyway, here are the benefits of unit testing, without justification or
explanation:

</div>

<div>

-   Easier to maintain code
-   Avoiding regressions
-   Make API clearer, both by describing it and by encouraging
    contracts.
-   Confidence in changes to code

<div>

For new contributors, there are other benefits:

</div>

<div>

-   Confidence in changes to code
-   Confidence in the validity of your own patch
-   Mechanism for exploring internal system behaviour

</div>

<div>

Some of the costs are:

</div>

<div>

-   Maintaining tests
-   Caring about the performance of tests
-   Running the tests
-   Debugging tests

<div>

For new contributors, there are other costs:

</div>

<div>

-   Finding tests
-   Figuring out how to run tests
-   Figuring out how to write tests
-   Learn unit testing

</div>

<div>

Is this fair? Is this clear? And exactly where was that post by that guy
about unit testing being overrated?

</div>

<div>

On a half-related and slightly exasperated note, many of the
conversations I've been having recently have been about costs and
benefits. What happened to doing something because it was the right
thing?

                <p>Yes - Language is very important in this debate. Test are more important
for dynamically typed languages (e.g. python), than for statically typed
languages (e.g. C#.)  </p>
<p>For example, if you rename a method, and you don't change one of the
caller of the method (cause you missed it,) the static language will
pick this up at compile time, but with the dynamic language, if you
don't have tests, it's going to show up later as a bug.</p>

                <p>You can focus on what's right only when there is no cost to consider.</p>

                <p>Sure, you don't need as many of the unit tests in a language like
Haskell, because you can encode some of the constraints on behavior in
the type system and the compiler will handle ensure these.  </p>
<p>But, I almost think I would be more inclined to do testing of at least
the core structures and functions of my applications if I were in
Haskell because in fact it sounds like it is easier. With tools like
QuickCheck and HPC and some more advanced checkers as well, there is a
large toolkit to do so.  </p>
<p>I recently have been re-reading Real World Haskell and Chapter 11
Testing and Quality Assurance
(http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/testing-and-quality-assurance.html)
makes me feel like the cost vs benefit ratio is definitely more bang for
buck.  </p>
<p>I also remember watching a talk by Don Stewart (and perhaps another of
the xmonad developers, I can't remember right now) about the development
of xmonad and the testing that went on. It was very enlightening.  </p>
<p>I feel like I'd be more prone to catch the TDD spirit (well, more
correctly the attitude that the code isn't done until it is tested)
while using Haskell than I have been using Python. I have not, in fact,
got into TDD in Python because it does seem onerous.</p>

                <p>> What happened to doing something because it was the right thing?  </p>
<p>This isn't a moral issue, you won't go to hell if you didn't write any
unit tests. ;-)  </p>
<p>Something is the right thing if the costs outweigh the benefits. Unit
tests clearly add value to the process, and for me it's just as clear
that the value is greater than the cost. Most people at least agree that
testing (of some kind) reduces the time-spent-per-bug.  </p>
<p>I think the debate is really about the <em>opportunity</em> cost of unit
testing; could we be doing some BETTER form of testing, if we weren't
writing unit tests?  </p>
<p>For me, the answer is "maybe, but I haven't heard about it yet".</p>

                <p>Cory, I wasn't talking about testing when I was talking about right
things, costs and benefits.  </p>
<p>Bice, I disagree..</p>

                <p>For me a major benefit is that you save time. I.e you don't have to
manually test something 100 times until it works correctly. You just run
the test and it should be able to automatically do the test in less time
than it would have taken to do it manually. With the added benefit that
you can redo the test in a months time without remembering exactly how
it works.  </p>
<p>Another advantage for me is that it gets you thinking about what exactly
you are trying to do before you spend the time going in circles of
implementation while you are still trying to figure out what you are
trying to do.<br />
Especially if you doing it right:<br />
