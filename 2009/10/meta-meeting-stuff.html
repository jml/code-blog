                <p>Last week the Launchpad team leads gathered in London and had an
absolutely huge meeting. Fifteen or sixteen smart, opinionated &amp;
passionate people in a room talking about the next six months of
Launchpad development. It was a lot of fun.  </p>
<p>When planning the agenda, Martin Albisetti and I were a little worried
about things wandering off track, so we thrashed out a lists of dos &amp;
don'ts. I'll blurt them out here, with the really terrible ideas
filtered out so I look more clever, and then offer some thoughts on how
they worked.  </p>
<p><span>Do</span>  </p>
<ul>
<li>be happy with the results of this meeting.</li>
<li>ask questions, especially "why"</li>
<li>be punctual</li>
<li>stay on point</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Don't<br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li>design features</li>
<li>check your email, i.e. laptops closed  </li>
<li>leave the meeting without being clear</li>
<li>leave the meeting without being happy</li>
</ul>
<p>The "laptops closed" one didn't work so well. It was great for the first
couple of days, but by Thursday afternoon there were always people in a
corner with those open LCD screens sucking chi out of the room like
little dragons of despair.  </p>
<p>The "Don't design features" rule was awesome. The rationale is that
feature design leads to long discussions, and that it does a disservice
to the many excellent engineers we have who aren't at the meeting and
will be actually implementing a feature. At best, it's waste and at
worst it's us telling people how to do something that they know how to
do better. The clearest sign that it was a good idea came when other
people started using it to shut me up.</p>

                <p>I wonder what to do about the "laptops not closed" problem. I guess the
solution depends on the cause...  </p>
<p><em>Email genuinely backing up and needs to be dealt with?</em> That certainly
sounds plausible after several days. Allocate some time for catching up
on demands from the outside world.  </p>
<p><em>Meeting fatigue â€” after several days of intense discussion perhaps some
people's capacity for engaging in intense discussion is simply
exhausted?</em> Not sure what to do about this except for taking more time
or doing less, neither of which is satisfactory. Or finding a way when
planning the week to accomodate the inevitable reduced energy towards
the end, e.g. shorter sessions and more breaks?  </p>
<p><em>Some participants don't think the current topic is very relevant to
them, or that their involvement is superfluous?</em> There's a pretty
important disconnect there... why did they attend in the first place,
and why were they invited? If circumstances have changed since the
meeting attendees were chosen then maybe there needs to be a way for
people to gracefully uninvite themselves.  </p>
<p>Put another way, if someone's laptop is not closed, why don't they just
excuse themselves and leave the room entirely? Perhaps there's no just
obvious way to do that politely. Or perhaps they feel obliged to be
there, but simultaneously don't agree that it's a good use of their time
(maybe just because they have meeting fatigue). That's a pretty serious
problem, and definitely a vibe-sucking one, and I'd love to know a good
solution.  </p>
<p>Maybe next time quietly approach a culprit during a break and ask them
as non-judgementally as possible why they've started opening their
laptop during a meeting?</p>

                <p>Re email checking, I don't know exactly how you set it up, but maybe
there's an introversion problem with these sprint meetings.  </p>
<p>You get a bunch of people, many of whom (I think) work from home.
They've travelled, they might be sharing a hotel room, they're spending
all day having high stakes, high bandwidth face-to-face interactions.
They socialise all evening. They sleep. They go round again. It may be
pretty draining especially compared to their usual quota of human
interaction.  </p>
<p>So it may be that some of them are trying to create some downtime for
themselves by laptopping. I don't have a good solution given the expense
of these meetings.</p>

                <p>FWIW, we deliberately scheduled an hour of "unstructured" time into each
day.  </p>
<p>Mary, although I can't speak for the others, you describe exactly how
I've felt at these things in the past, and yes, it is draining. Although
I can't think of any right now, perhaps there are more considerate ways
of handling this than opening up your laptop.  </p>
<p>Full disclosure: I also had my laptop open inappropriately at some
points of the meeting, and bear absolutely no ill will towards anyone
there who did the same.</p>
